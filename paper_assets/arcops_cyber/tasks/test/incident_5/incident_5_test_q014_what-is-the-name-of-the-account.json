  "context": "There was a detection of unknown malware being active in the environment, which was stopped by Windows Defender but it is recommended to further check the machine for signs of infection. Following that, there were multiple alerts indicating possible attempts to access Primary Refresh Token (PRT) which is a key artifact used for Azure AD authentication. Additionally, we observed an alert where system recovery settings were tampered with, indicating that adversaries might be attempting to delete or disable built-in operating system data and recovery services. This could prevent recovery of a corrupted system and denie access to backups and recovery options. Various built-in Windows utilities can be exploited to disable or delete system recovery features, posing a risk to system integrity.",
