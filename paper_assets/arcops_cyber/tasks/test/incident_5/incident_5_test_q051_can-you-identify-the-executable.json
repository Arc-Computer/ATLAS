  "context": "A security incident involving suspected tampering with system recovery settings using various commands and processes, including `vssblatemp.exe` to delete all volume shadow copies, was observed on device `vnevado-win11t` (AAD Device ID: `e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033`). During the incident, the process `vssblatemp.exe` was executed with command: `vssblatemp.exe delete shadows /all`. This is part of an adversarial attempt to prevent the recovery of corrupted systems by deleting built-in operating system data or turning off recovery services. The incident was detected on 2024-07-04. This tampering could deny access to available backups and recovery options, augmenting the effects of data destruction or data encryption.",
