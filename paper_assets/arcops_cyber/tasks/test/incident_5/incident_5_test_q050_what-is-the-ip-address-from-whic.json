  "context": "On 2024-07-04, there was a security incident involving suspicious WMI process creation on a machine. Malware often uses WMI to spawn new processes, breaking process trees and further infecting a machine. During this incident, various commands and scripts were executed, including `vssblatemp.exe delete shadows /all`, `bcdedit /set bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures`, and a PowerShell script `get-userprttoken.ps1`. This activity might be connected to a ransomware attack.",
