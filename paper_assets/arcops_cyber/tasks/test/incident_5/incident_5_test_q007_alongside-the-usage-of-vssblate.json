  "context": "A recent security incident involved the tampering of system recovery settings on the device `vnevado-win10r`. The process `vssblatemp.exe` was executed with the command `vssblatemp.exe delete shadows /all`, indicating an attempt to delete or remove built-in operating system data and turn off recovery services to prevent recovering a corrupted system. This may include deleting all volume shadow copies to impede system restoration.",
  "question": "Alongside the usage of `vssblatemp.exe`, another process was used to disable recovery features. What was the command and process ID of the other process involved?",
  "gold_answer": "Command: bcdedit /set recoveryenabled no, Process ID: 4312",
  "solution_steps": [
    "System recovery setting tampering has been detected on this device.",
