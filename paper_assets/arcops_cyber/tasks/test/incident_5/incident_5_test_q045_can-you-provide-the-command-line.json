  "context": "A security incident involving the Manatee Tempest activity group was reported. This Russia-based cybercriminal group, which has been active since June 2014, is known for malware campaigns including the Dridex banking trojan. They often gain initial access through methods such as drive-by downloads and malvertising, facilitated by their partnership with Mustard Tempest. As part of this security incident, a suspicious WMI process creation was observed on the machine `vnevado-win10r`, which might be an indicator of malware using WMI to spawn new processes and further infect the machine.",
