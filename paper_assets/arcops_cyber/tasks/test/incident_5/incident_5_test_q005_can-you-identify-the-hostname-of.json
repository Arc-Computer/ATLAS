  "context": "During a recent investigation involving potentially compromised assets exhibiting ransomware-like behavior, it was observed that an attacker might be using the specified user account, IP, or device to move laterally across the network. Some of the files involved are `syncretic.7z.lockbit`, `earlap.doc`, `ponceau.7z`, and `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit`. The suspicious activities were noted on the host `vnevado-win11u`, with associated account SID `S-0-6-5`. Automated remediation actions might be taken to disable the account or device being used by the attacker.",
  "question": "Can you identify the hostname of the device where system recovery setting tampering was observed?",
  "gold_answer": "vnevado-win10s",
  "solution_steps": [
    "The user with SID `S-1-5-21-1840191660-8534830288-125585561-1522` is potentially compromised and exhibiting ransomware-like behavior, affecting multiple devices.",
    "System recovery settings have been tampered with on the device with hostname `vnevado-win10s`, which could indicate an attempt by adversaries to disable system recovery features and prevent system recovery."
