  "context": "As part of a Ransomware infection observed in our organization, file backups were deleted via WMI or VSSAdmin on the host `vnevado-win10r`. The process involved was identified with ProcessId__CreatedTimeUtc__CommandLine `7236__2024-06-20t09:10:51.2193152z__vssblatemp.exe delete shadows /all`. Further investigation identified that system recovery setting tampering was observed on the same host, where adversaries might be attempting to delete or remove built-in operating systems data and turn off recovery services to prevent recovering a corrupted system. This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.",
  "question": "During the system recovery setting tampering, what process and command line was used to disable automatic Windows recovery features?",
  "gold_answer": "Process Id: 4828, Command Line: `bcdedit /set recoveryenabled no`",

    "An attack was detected where file backups were deleted via `vssblatemp.exe`.",
