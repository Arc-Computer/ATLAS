  "context": "A security incident involving ransomware-like behavior impacting several devices has been observed. Initial detection included the use of PsExec to launch a command on a remote device, suggesting lateral movement using this tool. This was followed by suspicious activities leading to compromised assets exhibiting ransomware-like behavior. The attacker might be using the specified user account, IP, or device to infect multiple devices with ransomware. Automated remediation actions were considered to address the threat.",
  "question": "What is the name of the file that is associated with the ransomware-like behavior?",
  "gold_answer": "ponceau.7z",
  "solution_steps": [
    "An attacker used the account `tgs2z` to launch a command on a remote device via PsExec.",
    "There was a lateral movement to the jump server with IP address `99.83.111.100` using PsExec.",
    "A file named `ponceau.7z` is associated with ransomware-like behavior, indicating potentially compromised assets."
