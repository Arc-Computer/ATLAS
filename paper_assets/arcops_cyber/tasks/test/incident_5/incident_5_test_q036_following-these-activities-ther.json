  "context": "A security incident involving system recovery setting tampering was observed on the device with name `vnevado-win10r`. The incident involved processes `vssblatemp.exe` and `bcdedit.exe` being executed on the host `vnevado-win10r` to potentially disrupt recovery options. Additionally, suspicious hands-on keyboard user behavior was detected around the same time, which might indicate that the user has been compromised.",
  "question": "Following these activities, there was an indication of ransomware behavior detected in the file system on a device. Can you determine the AadDeviceId of the host where this ransomware activity was detected?",

    "The account `dp5hn` was responsible for tampering with system recovery settings.",
    "The same host device with AadDeviceId `e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033` exhibited suspicious hands-on keyboard behavior, indicating a potential user compromise.",
    "Ransomware behavior was detected on the host with AadDeviceId `e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033`, indicating potential mass encryption of files by ransomware."
