  "context": "A suspicious WMI process creation was observed on the machine. Malware frequently uses WMI to spawn new processes, breaking process trees and further infecting a machine. This activity occurred at 2024-07-04 22:35:03.378778+00:00. During the same incident, there was a possible attempt to access Primary Refresh Token (PRT) detected. A PRT is a key artifact of Azure AD authentication and is a JSON Web Token (JWT) issued to enable single sign-on (SSO) across applications used on devices such as Windows 10 and later versions, iOS, and Android. Attackers might attempt to access this token to move laterally or perform credential theft.",
