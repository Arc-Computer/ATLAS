  "context": "In the context of a suspicious process executed PowerShell command on `2024-07-04`, an incident has been investigated involving the user `samuelf` with AAD user ID: `16320fec-8d90-403b-b7fe-78f715d4728d`. The process `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe` was executed using PowerShell with process ID: 8604. This PowerShell command is critical as it may allow an attacker to bypass security protection mechanisms by executing their payloads in memory, avoiding disk touches and thus leaving fewer traces.",
  "question": "Can you determine the hostname of the endpoint where the PowerShell script was executed as `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe`?",
