This process was used to create a scheduled task to run a potentially malicious file `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe`, which may indicate an attempt to establish persistence.",

    "A process invoked by `schtasks.exe` was involved in earlier malicious activity and used Task Scheduler to create, modify, or delete a task. This might be an attempt to launch malicious code automatically and establish persistence."
