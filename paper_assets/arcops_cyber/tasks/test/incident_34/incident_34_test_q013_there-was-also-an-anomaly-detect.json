  "context": "A security incident was detected on July 4th, 2024, where an uncommon file `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe` was created on the machine `vnevado-win10e` and added to a Run Key for persistence. The process responsible was launched by the user `samuelf` and has the ProcessId__CreatedTimeUtc__CommandLine `10208__2024-06-26t13:17:18.8268389z__reg add hkcu\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\runonce /f /v yrei /t reg_expand_sz /d %userprofile%\\desktop\\winatp-intro-backdoor.exe`. This suggests that an attacker may be trying to ensure persistent access even if the machine is rebooted.",
