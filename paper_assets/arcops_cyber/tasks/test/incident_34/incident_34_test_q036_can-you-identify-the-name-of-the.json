  "context": "During the investigation of a potential reconnaissance activity involving a suspicious LDAP query, it was found that `winword.exe` was used to execute a command file located at `c:\\scripts\\rs4_winatp-intro-invoice.docm`. This indicates that attackers may be attempting to learn the organization's structure by querying the domain controller for administrative users and groups, with the aim of gaining higher privileges. There is further suspicious activity involving Task Scheduler detected in the same timeframe.",
