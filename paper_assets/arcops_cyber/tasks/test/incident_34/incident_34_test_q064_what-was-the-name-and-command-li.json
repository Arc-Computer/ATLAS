  "context": "During the security investigation into an incident reported on 2024-07-04, it was noted that an uncommon file was created and added to a Run Key, which might indicate an attacker placing malicious software to maintain persistence on the machine. The process involved had an IP address `72.5.72.208` and executed the following command: `reg add hkcu\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\runonce /f /v yrei /t reg_expand_sz /d %userprofile%\\desktop\\winatp-intro-backdoor.exe`. There was also an indication of a suspicious PowerShell download or encoded command execution, which usually suggests an attempt to bypass security mechanisms.",
  "question": "What was the name and command line of the process involved in the suspicious PowerShell activity?",
