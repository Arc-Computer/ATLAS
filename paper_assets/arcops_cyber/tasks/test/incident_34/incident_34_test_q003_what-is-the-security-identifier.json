  "context": "A suspicious PowerShell activity was observed on a machine, which might indicate that PowerShell was used during installation, exploration, or lateral movement activities. This can be used by attackers to invoke modules, download external payloads, or get more information about the system. They often use PowerShell to bypass security protection mechanisms by executing their payload in memory without touching the disk and leaving any trace. Connected entities show the involvement of processes like `winword.exe` and `schtasks.exe`.",
