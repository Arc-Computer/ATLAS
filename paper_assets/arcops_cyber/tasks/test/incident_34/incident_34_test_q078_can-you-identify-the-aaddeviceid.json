  "context": "As part of investigating a Powershell-based security incident on July 4th, 2024, a suspicious file `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe` was dropped and executed on the machine by the user `samuelf`. The attacker used a base64 encoded command to create and execute the backdoor file using Powershell. The process ID related to this incident was `8604`, and the file `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe` was involved. Subsequently, an automated investigation was initiated manually by `u141(u141@ash.alpineskihouse.co)`, which started on the host device identified by its AKADeviceId. Can you identify the AKADeviceId for the host involved in this automated investigation?",
  "question": "Can you identify the AadDeviceId of the host where the Automated investigation was manually started?",
