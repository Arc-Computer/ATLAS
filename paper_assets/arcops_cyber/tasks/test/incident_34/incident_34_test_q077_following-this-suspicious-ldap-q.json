  "context": "On July 4, 2024, a suspect LDAP query was executed, which might indicate potential reconnaissance activity. LDAP queries are often used by attackers to learn an organization's structure by querying the domain controller for administrative users, groups, and interesting assets. This information can potentially be used by an attacker to gain higher privileges and access critical assets within the organization. Prior to this alert, a `winword.exe` process was observed running a document `rs4_winatp-intro-invoice.docm`.",
  "question": "Following this suspicious LDAP query, a Powershell command dropped and executed a suspicious file. Can you identify the name of this suspicious file?",
  "gold_answer": "winatp-intro-backdoor.exe",
  "solution_steps": [
    "A suspicious LDAP query was executed by the account `samuelf`, indicating potential reconnaissance activity.",
    "Powershell dropped a suspicious file named `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe` on the machine and executed it."
