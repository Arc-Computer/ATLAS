  "context": "During an investigation of a security incident, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed by a process identified with ProcessId 8604 on a host device. PowerShell is often used by attackers to bypass security protection mechanisms, execute their payloads in memory, and avoid detection. Following this activity, an uncommon file was created and added to a Run Key, which indicates an attacker might be trying to maintain persistence by ensuring the file runs after a system reboot.",
