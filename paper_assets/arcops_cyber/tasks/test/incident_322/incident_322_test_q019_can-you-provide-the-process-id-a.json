  "context": "In a recent security incident, emails containing a malicious URL `dj01161621.bravesand-e1ccd718.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io` were delivered to and later removed from the mailbox of alyssat@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co. The sender of the emails was raphaelt@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co, and the sender IP address was 202.205.215.225. Subsequently, Azure Resource Manager operations from a suspicious proxy IP address were detected, indicating potential malicious activity attempting to hide its source IP. These events are part of a broader investigation into suspicious activities within our network.",
