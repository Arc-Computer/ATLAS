This was linked to a host `vnevado-win11h.vnevado.alpineskihouse.co`. Subsequently, another alert on the same day identified a malicious URL click event, leading to the detection of suspicious Azure Resource Management (ARM) activities. These activities were performed by a user account that signed in to a risky session and triggered further alerts based on Microsoft Defender for Cloud.",
