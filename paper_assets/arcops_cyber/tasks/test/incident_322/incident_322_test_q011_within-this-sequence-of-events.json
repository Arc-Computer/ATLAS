  "context": "A suspicious multi-stage security incident was detected involving multiple alerts. Initially, a potentially malicious URL click was detected on August 1, 2024. The click was performed by a user `alyssat@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co`. This was followed by an alert indicating that email messages containing malicious URLs were removed after delivery. Subsequently, there was an alert from Azure Resource Manager noting a suspicious operation from a proxy IP address. These activities can be indicative of malicious behavior attempting to obfuscate their source.",
  "question": "Within this sequence of events, there was a suspicious credential dump from NTDS.dit. Can you identify the file name of the process that was used during this credential dump?",
  "gold_answer": "powershell.exe",

    "The email recipient `alyssat@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co` clicked on a potentially malicious URL.",
    "The email associated with the user having AadUserId `5e5dd0bd-f7ed-4583-8e9e-52f91e31a360` contained a malicious URL and was removed after delivery.",
    "There is a suspicious Azure Resource Manager operation from a proxy IP address originating from the host `vnevado-dc`.",
    "The process `powershell.exe` was used in a suspicious credential dump from the NTDS.dit to obtain user's credentials."
