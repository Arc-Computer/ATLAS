  "context": "As part of a suspected attack, the account `gsmith@niseko.alpineskihouse.co` was reported to have read the DKM key of an AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services) object. Following this, there were a series of suspicious exploration activities involving a set of windows commands that could indicate coordinated lateral movement by attackers. This was followed by a process that engaged in suspicious Task Scheduler activity to create, modify, or delete a task. This might be an attempt to launch malicious code automatically and establish persistence.
