  "context": "A security incident involved an attempt to hide the usage of a known public tool under the filename `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` with process ID 5752. This might indicate an effort to hide the tool's malicious use. Additionally, there was suspicious command execution via Impacket, often used in hands-on-keyboard attacks for lateral movement across the network.",

    "A user with AadUserId `ec3ec68b-fdeb-4fe4-9a29-acd445e1ccc5` was observed using a public dual-purpose tool under an unexpected filename, which might indicate an attempt to hide the use of the tool for malicious purposes.",
    "A suspicious execution of a command via the Impacket toolkit was observed on the device under the account `LocalSystem`. This suggests an ongoing hands-on-keyboard attack where an attacker might be attempting to move laterally across the network."
