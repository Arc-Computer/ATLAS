  "context": "A security incident involving a sensitive credential memory read was detected. A process scanned or dumped memory from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe). This process was run by the account `bjenkins` with SID `S-1-5-21-561436748-3867387497-1732241745-3701` and AAD UserID `a2d0f7c2-b0a0-43bd-bce0-27d8ae3be4d0`. Specifically, the command used was `powershell.exe -noexit -command set-location -literalpath 'c:\\users\\bjenkins\\downloads\\midnight14'`. Accessing the memory of lsass.exe allows attackers to potentially extract authentication hashes or passwords.",
