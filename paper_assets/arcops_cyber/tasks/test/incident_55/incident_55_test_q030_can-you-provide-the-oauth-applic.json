  "context": "A security incident started with an alert indicating that a known public tool, which could be used maliciously, was observed under an unexpected filename. The file `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` was executed on the host `mb-adfs` by the account `gsmith`. Subsequent alerts indicated ongoing hands-on-keyboard attacks via the Impacket toolkit, followed by a process injecting potentially malicious code. A suspicious activity was then recorded where the user Luciano Herrera (pwilson@niseko.alpineskihouse.co) performed an unusual addition of credentials to the application SimulandApp. This could indicate that the app has been compromised for phishing or data exfiltration.",
  "question": "Can you provide the OAuth application ID for the app to which Luciano Herrera added the credential?",

    "The account `gsmith` was involved with an attempt to hide the use of a suspicious dual-purpose tool.",
    "A command was executed via Impacket using the process `powershell.exe`, which indicates a potential hands-on-keyboard attack.",
    "The account with SID `S-1-5-21-551436448-9871687716-9837441745-1903` was associated with a process injection event, suggesting malicious code was injected into another process.",
