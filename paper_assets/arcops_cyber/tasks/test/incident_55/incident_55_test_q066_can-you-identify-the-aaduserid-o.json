  "context": "A suspicious execution of a command via the Impacket toolkit was observed on the host `mb-adfs`, indicating potential lateral movement by attackers. This hands-on-keyboard attack used the tool to explore network shares and execute commands, which generally leads to installing ransomware or other payloads on target devices. Connected to this, there was a command executed with the PowerShell process `powershell.exe`. This was seen involving the accounts `gsmith` and `LocalSystem`, as well as the host `mb-adfs`.",
