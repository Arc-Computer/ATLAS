  "context": "A suspected DCSync attack was detected on July 10, 2024, where Luciano Herrera (CIO) on host MB-WINCLIENT sent a replication request to MB-DC1. This is considered suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to replicate directory services. Moreover, a suspicious LDAP query execution on the same host was noted earlier on July 4, 2024. LDAP queries can be used for reconnaissance activities, potentially to map out the organization's structure.",
  "question": "During the ongoing hands-on-keyboard attack via the Impacket toolkit observed on July 4, 2024, what user account name was the execution attributed to?",
  "gold_answer": "LocalSystem",
  "solution_steps": [
    "The user account with SID `S-1-5-21-551436448-9871687716-9837441745-1903` (Luciano Herrera, CIO) on MB-WINCLIENT made a replication request to MB-DC1, suggesting a suspected DCSync attack.",
    "A suspicious LDAP query was executed using `powershell.exe`, indicating potential reconnaissance activity.",
    "A command was executed using the Impacket toolkit by the `LocalSystem` account, suggesting an ongoing hands-on-keyboard attack."
