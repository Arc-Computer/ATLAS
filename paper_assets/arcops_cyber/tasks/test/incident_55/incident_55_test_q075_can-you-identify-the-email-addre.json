  "context": "A suspicious sequence of exploration activities has been detected on host `mb-winclient` involving various processes like `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe`. One of the involved accounts is `bjenkins`, and the activity is likely part of an attacker's efforts to identify assets and coordinate lateral movement after compromising the machine. One of the alerts in this sequence indicated potentially malicious service creation by another account.",
