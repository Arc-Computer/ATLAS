  "context": "A security incident involving an ADFS private key extraction attempt with a suspicious LDAP query launched from user account `gsmith` was reported. The incident occurred on host `mb-adfs` through a process with command line `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe`. Notably, attackers might be attempting to steal ADFS private keys or move laterally on the network. There were subsequent alerts suggesting ongoing hands-on-keyboard attacks and suspicious system hardware discovery activities which likely indicate further attempts of reconnaissance and lateral movement across the network.",
  "question": "Can you identify the user involved in the suspicious system hardware discovery? What is the name of the account?",

    "A suspicious LDAP query was launched by the user with AAD User ID `ec3ec68b-fdeb-4fe4-9a29-acd445e1ccc5`, potentially attempting to steal ADFS private keys or move laterally on the network.",
    "A hands-on-keyboard attack via the Impacket toolkit was detected, with `powershell.exe` being executed on the device to explore network shares and execute commands.",
    "The user account `pwilson` was involved in suspicious system hardware discovery, which may be an attempt to gather information for future attacks."
