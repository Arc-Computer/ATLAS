  "context": "In an ongoing investigation, a malicious URL `https://ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/` was clicked on a device, which triggered a process injection of potentially malicious code. Subsequently, there was a suspicious sequence of exploration activities indicating that a process executed several Windows commands, possibly to identify assets of value and coordinate lateral movement. This was followed by a system program being registered as a service, which suggests malicious intent to establish persistence or gain system privileges.",
  "question": "Can you identify the file name of the process that was registered as a service during this suspicious activity?",
  "gold_answer": "services.exe",
  "solution_steps": [
    "There was a click on a malicious URL on the device with hostname `mb-winclient`.",
    "A process with filename `powershell.exe` was injected with potentially malicious code.",
    "On the host `mb-adfs`, a suspicious sequence of exploration activities involving a set of windows commands was identified.",
    "A system program with filename `services.exe` was registered as a suspicious service, potentially indicating malicious intent to establish persistence or gain system privileges."
