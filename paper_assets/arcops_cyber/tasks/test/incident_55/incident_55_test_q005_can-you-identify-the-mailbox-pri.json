  "context": "In a recent incident, the host `MB-DC1` read the DKM key of ADFS object id 4cac49d3-29d3-407e-8c9b-b7ebb21541b2. This was followed by a suspected DCSync attack where Luciano Herrera (CIO) on MB-WINCLIENT sent 1 replication request to the aforementioned host. Subsequently, a series of suspicious exploration activities were recorded, possibly indicating an attacker attempting to identify assets of value and coordinate lateral movement. Lastly, it was observed that an email containing a malicious URL was delivered and later removed.",
  "question": "Can you identify the mailbox primary address where the email containing the malicious URL was delivered and later removed?",
