  "context": "As part of investigating a suspicious access to the LSASS service, which may indicate an attacker attempting to obtain clear-text passwords from the LSASS service's memory, it was noted that the file `lsass.exe` was involved in this activity on the host `mb-winclient`. The attacker may use these credentials for lateral movement activities. Further investigation reveals that a suspicious Task Scheduler activity occurred around the same time where a process was used to create, modify, or delete a task, indicating a possible attempt to launch malicious code automatically and establish persistence.",
  "question": "Can you identify the name of the process used in the suspicious Task Scheduler activity?",

    "A powershell.exe process accessed the LSASS service to potentially decrypt user's clear-text passwords.",
    "A process `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` was involved in suspicious Task Scheduler activity, which could be an attempt to launch malicious code automatically and establish persistence."
