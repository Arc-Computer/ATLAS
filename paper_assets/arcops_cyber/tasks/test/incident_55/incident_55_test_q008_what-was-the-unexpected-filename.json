  "context": "An incident was reported involving suspicious access to the LSASS service on the host identified by the name `mb-winclient`. Attackers aimed to decrypt the password stored in the LSASS service's memory, a step often linked to lateral movement activities. Following this, there was a detection of a suspicious execution of a command using the Impacket toolkit on the same device, which is indicative of further lateral movement attempts. Subsequently, an attempt to run a tool with both benign and malicious uses under an unexpected filename was observed. This specific action was carried out to potentially hide its malicious intent.",
  "question": "What was the unexpected filename observed in an attempt to hide the use of a dual-purpose tool?",
  "gold_answer": "iy2orr1e.rrg.exe",
  "solution_steps": [
    "There is a suspicious access to the LSASS service using the process `powershell.exe`.",
