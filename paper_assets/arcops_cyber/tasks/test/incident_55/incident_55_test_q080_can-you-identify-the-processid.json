  "context": "A malicious URL `https://ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/` was clicked on a device at 11:24 AM on 2024-07-10, indicating potential malicious activity. Following this event, a suspicious LDAP query was executed on 2024-07-04, which might indicate reconnaissance by an attacker trying to learn the organization's structure. Later, a series of exploration activities were noted, suggesting that the attacker was identifying valuable assets and planning lateral movement after compromising a machine. The final observed activity was an attempt to use a dual-purpose tool under an unexpected filename, likely as an effort to conceal malicious intentions.",
  "question": "Can you identify the ProcessId, the exact time the process was created, and the command line used for the process that attempted to hide the use of a dual-purpose tool?",
