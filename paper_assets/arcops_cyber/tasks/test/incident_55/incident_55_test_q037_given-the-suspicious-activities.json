  "context": "As part of a recent security incident, a process named `contosoadfsblatempcreds.ps1` was executed on `mb-winclient` by account `pwilson`. The process ID was 13968, and it was run using PowerShell. This process might have injected code into another process, indicating suspicious code execution within a trusted process. A subsequent alert indicated suspicious Task Scheduler activity, involving modification or deletion of a task, potentially to launch malicious code automatically and establish persistence.",
