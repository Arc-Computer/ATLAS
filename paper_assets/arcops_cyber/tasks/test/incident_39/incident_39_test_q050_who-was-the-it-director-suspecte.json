  "context": "A recent security incident involved suspicions of processes stopping services on a device, which is often an attacker strategy to avoid detection or to disrupt operations. One of the suspicious processes involved was `net.exe` with ProcessId `6428`, and it was executed on host `vnevado-dc` by an account with the name `lucasb`. This incident was part of a larger pattern of malicious activities that included stopping services running on the device and manipulating user privileges in the network. The process `powershell.exe` was also executed in this context with ProcessId `3780`.",
