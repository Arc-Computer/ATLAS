  "context": "During an observed security incident, an attacker may have utilized the Rubeus tool on endpoint `vnevado-win10b` for kerberoasting and possibly other Kerberos-related attacks. It's possible that the attacker requested Kerberos tickets for a specific account's service principal name (SPN) and decrypted them to acquire plaintext credentials, or used the pass-the-ticket technique. This was detected with execution of specific processes, and the attack continued with the dropping and launching of files from a remote location, potentially indicating lateral movement. Following this, a Security Identification (SID) history injection was detected on the same device, pointing to an attacker possibly gaining elevated privileges.",
  "question": "What is the name of the file involved in the SID history injection detected during this incident?",
  "gold_answer": "dkwj.mze",
  "solution_steps": [
    "Activity indicating the use of the Rubeus tool was observed on the endpoint with the process `psexesvc.exe`.",
    "A remote session dropped a file and executed it using an account with AadUserId `7fcf9695-68fc-4258-864d-e1e5b166c66f`.",
    "A Security IDentifcation (SID) history injection was detected involving the file `dkwj.mze`."
