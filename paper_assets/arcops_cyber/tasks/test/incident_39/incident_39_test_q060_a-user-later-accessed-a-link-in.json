  "split": "test",
  "context": "A security incident involved the possible use of the Rubeus kerberoasting tool. This tool was detected on host `vnevado-win10b` and might have been used to request and potentially decrypt Kerberos tickets for an account's service principal name (SPN). Observed processes related to this incident include `psexesvc.exe` and `rubeus.exe`. Additionally, a command line was executed using `cmd` to dump data to `c:\\temp\\adminticket.txt`. This indicates a possible kerberoasting attempt, where attackers seek plaintext credentials or use pass-the-ticket techniques for authentication.",
  "question": "A user later accessed a link in an email that was quarantined by zero-hour auto purge (ZAP). Can you provide the URL that was accessed?",
  "gold_answer": "https://ac27145722.livelygrass-8d4c4013.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/",
  "solution_steps": [
    "The process `rubeus.exe` was identified as being used, indicating a possible Rubeus kerberoasting attack.",
    "The attack was associated with an account having SID `S-5-7-21-1843151660-3234030288-105586167-1422`.",
    "A user accessed a malicious link `https://ac27145722.livelygrass-8d4c4013.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/` in a ZAP-quarantined email."
