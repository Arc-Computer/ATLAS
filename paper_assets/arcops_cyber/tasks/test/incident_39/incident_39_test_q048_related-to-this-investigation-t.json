  "context": "A security incident was detected involving a deceptive user account `kyleg` on the host `vnevado-win10b`. This device has the AadDeviceId `fafdcd65-46c6-45a6-aa85-ec9b77ca0bcb` and the IP address `141.216.110.153`. A sign-in attempt was made using this deceptive account, which could indicate a potential attacker is trying to use it for malicious activities including accessing sensitive data. Further investigation revealed a sequence of alerts indicating potential human-operated malicious activity on the same device, which might lead to ransomware or other harmful payloads.",
  "question": "Related to this investigation, there is a suspected overpass-the-hash attack (Kerberos). Can you provide the email of the helpdesk administrator who attempted to authenticate against VNEVADO-DC from VNEVADO-Win10V?",
