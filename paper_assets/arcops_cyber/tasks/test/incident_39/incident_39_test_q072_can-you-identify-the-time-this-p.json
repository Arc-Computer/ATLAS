  "context": "As part of a recent security investigation, we detected the execution of a known credential theft tool, `mimikatz.exe`, on host `vnevado-win10v` associated with the user account `tgs2z`. The tool was executed with the command line: `mimikatz.exe privilege::debug 'kerberos::ptt c:\\m365dattack\\admin-tickets' exit`. Shortly after, there was activity indicating the use of the Rubeus kerberoasting tool connected to this endpoint. Following this, an alert notified that a file was dropped and launched from a remote location, suggesting a possible lateral movement or propagation attempt.",
