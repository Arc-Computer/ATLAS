  "context": "A security incident involving anomalous account lookups was reported. During this incident, an anomalous chain of attempts to look up user account information was detected, hinting at a potential attacker gathering information about potential targets. During this investigation, we observed that an attacker might have used the malicious script file named `domaindominance27.ps1` and several 'net' commands were executed to manipulate user and group accounts. Additionally, a SID history injection was detected on this device, suggesting that an attacker may have elevated domain user privileges to access sensitive files and system settings.",
  "question": "Can you identify the name of the account involved in the suspected identity theft (pass-the-ticket) attack?",
