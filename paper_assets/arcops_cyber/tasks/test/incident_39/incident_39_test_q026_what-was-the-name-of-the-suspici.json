  "context": "As part of a recent security incident, there was a successful logon using overpass-the-hash with potentially stolen credentials. The attacker accessed a resource with credentials linked to an account identified by the name `fk8mq` and associated with the IP address `141.216.110.153`. The attack involved the use of the file `lsass.exe`, which is commonly targeted to obtain password hashes from memory to perform overpass-the-hash attacks.",
