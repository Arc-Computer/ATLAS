  "context": "A security incident involving BEC (business email compromise) fraud attempts. Suspicious emails were sent by a possibly compromised user account with the email address `tony@avoriaz.alpineskihouse.co`, originating from the IP address `255.246.85.58`. These emails were sent by `laylaw@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co` also from IP address `255.246.85.58`. Following this, there was suspicious SAP authentication using a user account with a risky sign-in alert in Microsoft Entra ID. An attacker might have taken control of a user account to search through SAP with the intention of recording or modifying sensitive financial information, which could be used later for phishing or social engineering.",
  "question": "Can you identify the IP address used in the suspicious SAP authentication event?",
  "gold_answer": "107.253.5.27",
  "solution_steps": [
    "A possibly compromised user account with the name `Jordan P` sent suspicious emails related to an ongoing BEC fraud attempt.",
    "A user account with a risky sign-in alert signed in to SAP from IP address `107.253.5.27`, possibly by an attacker intending to search, record, or modify sensitive financial information."
