  "context": "A suspicious SAP authentication was detected, where a user account with a risky sign-in alert in Microsoft Entra ID signed in to SAP. This could indicate that an attacker might have taken control of a user account to search for or modify sensitive financial information in SAP. As part of the connection, there was an entity with the IP address `107.253.5.27` linked to the user account: Name: Jordan P, Email: Jordan P@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co, and SID: S-1-5-21-1740051960-3534030288-108486866-1602. This might lead to later stages of the attack, such as phishing or social engineering.",
  "question": "Can you identify the IP address from which an anonymous sign-in was attempted in connection with this suspicious SAP authentication?",
