  "context": "As part of a recent security incident, a Windows executable file that had been renamed was launched on the host `mb-adfs`. The file executed was `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` with process ID 3116, an action that could indicate malicious intent such as running unauthorized code or connecting to an attacker-controlled network address. Following this, a malicious PowerShell Cmdlet was invoked, which could be associated with credential theft or network reconnaissance. Ultimately, emails containing a malicious URL were detected and removed after delivery.",
  "question": "What is the email address that received the message containing a malicious URL which was later removed after delivery?",

    "An email containing a malicious URL was delivered and then removed. The recipient was `bjenkins@niseko.alpineskihouse.co`."
