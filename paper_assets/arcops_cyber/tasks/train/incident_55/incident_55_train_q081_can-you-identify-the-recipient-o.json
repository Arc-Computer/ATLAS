  "context": "A multi-stage security incident involving various malicious activities was observed. Initially, a suspicious file named `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` was launched on the host `mb-adfs` by the account `gsmith`. This might have been an attempt to hide the use of a dual-purpose tool for malicious activities. Following this, there were signs of a system executable being renamed and possibly used for malicious purposes, code injection into processes, and an account sending phishing emails. The incident eventually led to malicious URL-containing emails being delivered and then removed.",
  "question": "Can you identify the recipient of the email messages containing the malicious URL that were removed after delivery?",
  "gold_answer": "santiago@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co",
  "solution_steps": [
    "The host `mb-adfs` saw an attempt to hide the use of a dual-purpose tool.",
    "A renamed Windows executable `powershell.exe` was launched, potentially for malicious activities.",
    "Code injection was detected in a process belonging to an account with SID `S-1-5-21-561436748-3867387497-1732241745-3701`.",
    "An internal user account `Nina Sullivan@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co` sent phishing emails within the organization, indicating possible account compromise.",
    "Emails containing malicious URLs and sent to `santiago@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co` were removed after delivery."
