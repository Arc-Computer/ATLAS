  "context": "In a recent security incident, the host `MB-DC1` read the DKM key of an ADFS object with id 4cac49d3-29d3-407e-8c9b-b7ebb21541b2, which indicated a suspected AD FS DKM key read. Following this, there was also a suspected DCSync attack where the user Luciano Herrera (CIO) from the host `MB-WINCLIENT` sent a replication request to host `MB-DC1`. Additionally, there was a process executing a suspicious sequence of exploration activities and suspicious execution of a command via the Impacket toolkit, indicating potential lateral movement attempts using this toolkit.",
  "question": "Can you identify the email of the account that created the suspicious service DDLOXJDSQSNGMUKKFUXQ on MB-ADFS?",
