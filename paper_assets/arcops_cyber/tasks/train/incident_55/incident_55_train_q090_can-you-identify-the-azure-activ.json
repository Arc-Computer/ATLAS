  "context": "A suspected Active Directory attack was detected on host `MB-DC1` where it read the DKM key of ADFS object id `4cac49d3-29d3-407e-8c9b-b7ebb21541b2`. Following this, Luciano Herrera (CIO) on host `MB-WINCLIENT` sent 1 replication request to `MB-DC1`, indicating a possible DCSync attack. Further investigation revealed a suspicious LDAP query executed on the host, indicating potential reconnaissance activity which could be used by attackers to gain higher privileges and access important assets in the organization.",
  "question": "Can you identify the Azure Active Directory (AAD) user ID related to the suspicious sequence of exploration activities?",
