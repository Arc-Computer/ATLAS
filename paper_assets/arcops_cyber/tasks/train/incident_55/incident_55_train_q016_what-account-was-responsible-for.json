  "context": "A suspicious remote activity on a machine occurred as part of a recent security incident. This incident involved attempts to initiate interactive sessions, modify files, pass WMI commands, create scheduled tasks, and other potentially malicious activities from a remote machine. Notably, the file `cmd.exe` was executed with ProcessId `8896` on 2024-07-02, indicating a possibility of a remote activity. The compromised machine is yet to be identified (host name missing).",
  "question": "What account was responsible for the launching of the renamed and executed system executable in the end alert?",
  "gold_answer": "SYSTEM",
  "solution_steps": [
    "Suspicious remote activity was observed on the host `mb-adfs` which could involve actions such as initiating interactive sessions, modifying files, passing WMI commands, or creating scheduled tasks.",
    "A system executable that was renamed was launched on the account `SYSTEM`, indicating possible attempts to use it for malicious activities or to connect to an attacker-controlled network."
