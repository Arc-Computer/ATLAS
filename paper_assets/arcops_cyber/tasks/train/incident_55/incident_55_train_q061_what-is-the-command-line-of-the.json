Following this event, there were suspicious sequences of exploration activities observed that involved a process executing a set of windows commands, which can be used by attackers to identify valuable assets and coordinate lateral movement after system compromise. Another part of this incident indicates the use of a known public tool with an unusual filename, suggesting an attempt to hide its malicious usage.",
