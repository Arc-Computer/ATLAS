  "context": "As part of a recent security incident, a malicious URL `https://ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/` was accessed, followed by a malicious PowerShell Cmdlet invocation on the device. Both events are related to suspicious activities, including network reconnaissance, code injection, and potentially credential theft. An alert of suspicious Task Scheduler activity reported a process potentially used for launching malicious code automatically and establishing persistence.",
