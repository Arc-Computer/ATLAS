  "context": "In a recent suspicious activity involving Task Scheduler on host `mb-adfs`, a process `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` was launched using `schtasks.exe` by the user `adfsadmin` and had run various encoded commands. This could be an attempt to automate the launch of malicious code and establish persistence in the system. A related security incident has been flagged where code injection was detected, indicating malicious behavior in a process memory.",
