  "context": "There has been an ongoing hands-on-keyboard attack via the Impacket toolkit. Suspicious execution of a command was observed on a device. This tool connects to other hosts to explore network shares and execute commands, often used in hands-on-keyboard attacks where ransomware and other payloads are installed on target devices. During this incident, a malicious PowerShell Cmdlet was invoked on the machine, likely associated with credential theft, exploitation, network reconnaissance, or code injection. Following this, Luciano Herrera (CIO) on `MB-WINCLIENT` sent one replication request to another host on the network.",
  "question": "There was a suspected AD FS DKM key read in the final alert, which host was involved in reading the DKM key?",
  "gold_answer": "MB-DC1",
  "solution_steps": [
    "Suspicious execution of a command via Impacket toolkit observed on process `powershell.exe`.",
    "A malicious PowerShell Cmdlet invoked by the account with AadUserId `2de70991-2799-4a95-b734-8e3df3a50118`.",
    "Luciano Herrera (CIO) on MB-WINCLIENT sent 1 replication request to host `MB-DC1`, indicating a suspected DCSync attack.",
    "Host `MB-DC1` read the DKM key of ADFS object id `4cac49d3-29d3-407e-8c9b-b7ebb21541b2`, signalling a suspected AD FS DKM key read."
