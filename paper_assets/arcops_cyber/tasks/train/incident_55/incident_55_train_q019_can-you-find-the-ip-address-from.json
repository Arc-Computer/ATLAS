  "context": "A multi-stage security incident has been reported. It started with a known public tool observed under an unexpected filename (`iy2orr1e.rrg.exe`) attempting to hide its usage possibly for malicious purposes, executed with ProcessId 5752. Subsequently, suspicious remote activity was reported, followed by a suspicious LDAP query indicating potential reconnaissance activity. The incidents culminated with an unusual addition of credentials to an OAuth app, SimulandApp, by the user Luciano Herrera (pwilson@niseko.alpineskihouse.co). The user added a credential of type Password, which could indicate app compromise and potential misuse.",
