Initially, Lucas Grey (Email: Lucas Grey@niseko.alpineskihouse.co) accessed a suspicious URL: `http://ym018491661.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/`. Following this event, there was an alert indicating the execution of a malicious PowerShell Cmdlet on a device. Further investigation revealed a potential DCSync attack initiated by Luciano Herrera (CIO) from MB-WINCLIENT, who sent a replication request to another machine. The final alert indicated that a key was accessed on that machine.",
