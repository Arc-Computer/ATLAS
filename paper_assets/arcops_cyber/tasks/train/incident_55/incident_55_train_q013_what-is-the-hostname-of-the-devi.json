  "context": "During a recent security investigation, it was identified that host `MB-DC1` read the DKM key of an ADFS object (`4cac49d3-29d3-407e-8c9b-b7ebb21541b2`). Following this, there was a suspected DCSync attack where a replication request was sent from `MB-WINCLIENT` by Luciano Herrera (CIO) to `MB-DC1`. Then, it was observed that a known tool or technique was used to gather information on a device in a suspicious system hardware discovery attempt. Eventually, a suspicious Task Scheduler activity was reported where a process involved in earlier malicious activity used Task Scheduler to create, modify, or delete a task. This might be an attempt to launch malicious code automatically and establish persistence. For further information on this threat, read the corresponding threat analytics report.",
  "question": "What is the hostname of the device involved in the suspicious Task Scheduler activity?",

    "The host `MB-DC1` read the DKM key of ADFS object id `4cac49d3-29d3-407e-8c9b-b7ebb21541b2`.",
    "The account with AadUserID `2de70991-2799-4a95-b734-8e3df3a50118`, used the host `MB-WINCLIENT` to send a replication request to `MB-DC1`.",
    "A known tool or technique using `powershell.exe` was used to gather system hardware information.",
    "A process associated with suspicious activity used Task Scheduler on the host `mb-adfs` to create, modify, or delete a task."
