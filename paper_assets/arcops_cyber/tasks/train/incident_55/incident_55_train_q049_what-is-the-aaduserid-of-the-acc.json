  "context": "In a recent security incident, an unusual addition of credentials to an OAuth application was performed by the user Luciano Herrera, which indicated a potential compromise. The user, associated with the email Luciano Herrera@niseko.alpineskihouse.co, might be involved in spreading phishing, exfiltrating data, or gaining access to other accounts. Subsequent alerts indicated suspicious LDAP queries and exploration activities, eventually leading to an observed attempt to hide the use of a dual-purpose tool under an unexpected filename.",
