  "context": "As part of a security incident that began with an email containing a malicious URL (`http://kn017721628.wittytree-b6f239d6.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/`) being delivered to the mailbox `santiago@vnevado.alpineskihouse.co` and subsequently removed, it was observed that a user sent phishing emails from within the organization possibly indicating their account had been compromised. Further investigation revealed that a process was injected with suspicious code potentially connecting to a C2 server or opening a listening port, which escalated until finally a malicious URL was clicked on a device.",
