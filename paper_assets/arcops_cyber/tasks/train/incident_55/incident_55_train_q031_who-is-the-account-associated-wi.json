  "context": "A recent security incident on the host `mb-adfs` involved multiple malicious activities. Initially, the system executable `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` was renamed and launched, potentially by an attacker aiming to run malicious code or connect to an attacker-controlled network address while avoiding certain behavior-based detection technologies. The process is associated with the account `SYSTEM` with SID `S-2-2-78`.",
