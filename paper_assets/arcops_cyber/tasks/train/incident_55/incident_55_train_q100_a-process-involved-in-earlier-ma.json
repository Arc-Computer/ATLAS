  "context": "During the investigation of a security incident involving unusual addition of credentials to an OAuth application by Luciano Herrera (`Luciano Herrera@niseko.alpineskihouse.co`), multiple malicious activities were identified. The user added a credential of type Password to the app SimulandApp. This pattern can indicate credential compromise and potential abuse of the OAuth app. Subsequently, a suspicious LDAP query was executed indicating potential reconnaissance activity.",
  "question": "A process involved in earlier malicious activity used Task Scheduler to run a task. Can you identify the process ID and the created timestamp of this activity along with the command line used?",
