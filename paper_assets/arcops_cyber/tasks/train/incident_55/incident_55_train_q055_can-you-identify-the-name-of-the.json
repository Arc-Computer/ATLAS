  "context": "A known public tool, which could also be used for malicious reasons, was observed under an unexpected filename on 2024-07-06. The tool might be attempting to hide its usage for malicious purposes. Following this, on 2024-07-04, a process involved in earlier malicious activity used Task Scheduler to create, modify, or delete a task, potentially to automatically launch malicious code and establish persistence. For further information on this threat, you can read the following threat analytics report: https://security.microsoft.com/threatanalytics3/c9709a39-ac8d-493d-9a63-71da3ca1e745/analystreport. Ultimately, a process has injected code into another process, indicating that suspicious code is running in the target process memory. Injection is often used to hide malicious code execution within a trusted process, leading to possible abnormal behaviors such as opening a listening port or connecting to a command and control server.",
  "question": "Can you identify the name of the account associated with the process that was injected with potentially malicious code?",
  "gold_answer": "bjenkins",
  "solution_steps": [
    "A process with the filename `iy2orr1e.rrg.exe` was detected, which might be attempting to hide the usage of a dual-purpose tool for malicious purposes.",
    "A process `powershell.exe` involved in earlier suspicious activity used Task Scheduler to potentially create, modify, or delete tasks, indicating an attempt to launch malicious code automatically and establish persistence.",
    "A process was injected with potentially malicious code, and the associated account is `bjenkins`."
