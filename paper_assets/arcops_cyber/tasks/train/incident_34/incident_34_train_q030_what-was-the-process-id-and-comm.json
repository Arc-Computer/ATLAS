  "context": "As part of a recent security incident, a suspicious process executed a PowerShell command on host `vnevado-win10e`. The command indicated the creation of a malicious file named `winatp-intro-backdoor.exe`. This activity suggests an attacker bypassing security protection mechanisms by executing their payload in memory without leaving any trace. Alarmingly, such threats often use scheduled tasks to maintain persistence on the system.",
