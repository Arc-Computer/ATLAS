  "context": "A security incident involved the execution of a suspicious LDAP query, indicating potential reconnaissance activity. Attackers often use LDAP queries to learn the organization's structure, such as administrative users, groups, and interesting assets. These queries help the attacker gain higher privileges and access important assets in the organization. During the investigation, we observed that the process `winword.exe` launched with the command line `winword.exe c:\\scripts\\rs4_winatp-intro-invoice.docm`.",
