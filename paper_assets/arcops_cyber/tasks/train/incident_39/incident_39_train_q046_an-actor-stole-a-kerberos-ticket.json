  "context": "During a security incident, multiple known public tools like `domaindominance27.ps1`, `psexec.exe`, `mimikatz.exe`, and `rubeus.exe`, which may be used for malicious reasons, were dropped on a device. This might indicate steps for credential theft, privilege escalation, or lateral movement by attackers. Subsequently, a sign-in attempt was detected using a deceptive user account, suggesting a potential attacker might use a decoy account on the device.",
  "question": "An actor stole a Kerberos ticket from Julian Burke and used it to access resources. Can you identify the security identifier (SID) associated with Julian Burke's account?",

    "Multiple dual-purpose tools that could be used for malicious activities were dropped on a device by an account with AadUserId `1d94aaf6-efe6-4e76-ad56-ffd7d1257bc1`.",

    "A suspected identity theft (pass-the-ticket) occurred where an actor took Julian Burke (IT director)'s Kerberos ticket from VNEVADO-Win10B and used it on VNEVADO-Win10V to access 4 resources, with the account having SID `S-1-0-25-1848151668-3534030238-185306563-542`."
