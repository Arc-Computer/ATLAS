  "context": "Involving a security incident where an attacker might be gathering information about potential targets, a series of anomalous account lookups were detected, with activities conducted using the `net.exe` process to query user and group information on the domain. Shortly after, suspicious access to the LSASS service was detected, indicating potential credential theft to obtain clear-text passwords, likely intending lateral movement across the network. This can lead to an attack where overpass-the-hash method is employed for successful logon using stolen credentials.",
  "question": "Can you identify the Security Identifier (SID) of the account that was used in the overpass-the-hash attack?",
  "gold_answer": "S-2-2-78",
  "solution_steps": [
    "An anomalous chain of attempts to look up user account information has been observed on host `vnevado-win10v`.",
    "Suspicious access to the LSASS service has been detected, involving the process `lsass.exe`.",
    "An attacker successfully logged on using an overpass-the-hash attack with the account having SID `S-2-2-78`."
