  "context": "As an addition to the Kekeo malware investigation on host `vnevado-win10b`, there was also a suspicious sequence of exploration activities identified. Such windows commands can be leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance and to coordinate lateral movement after compromising a machine. We need to further analyze this by identifying the specific process that performed these reconnaissance activities.",

    "An active 'Kekeo' malware was detected running the process `rubeus.exe`.",
    "PsExec was used to launch a command on a remote device, running the process `net.exe`.",
