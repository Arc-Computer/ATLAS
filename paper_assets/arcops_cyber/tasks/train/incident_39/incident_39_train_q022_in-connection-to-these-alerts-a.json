  "context": "A security incident occurred where multiple dual-purpose tools were dropped on a device named `vnevado-win10v`. These tools can potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement. One of the dropped files was named `domaindominance27.ps1`, launched by `powershell.exe` via a script located in the user's downloads. Following this, there was an indication of human-operated malicious activity that might lead to serious consequences like ransomware installation.",

  "gold_answer": "services.exe",
  "solution_steps": [
    "The file `rubeus.exe` was dropped on this device, which is a known dual-purpose tool.",
    "A potentially malicious process `psexesvc.exe` was observed on this device, indicating possible human-operated malicious activity.",
    "A suspicious service `services.exe` was launched on this device, which might be used by attackers to maintain persistence or elevate privileges."
