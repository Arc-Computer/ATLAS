  "context": "A known credential theft tool was executed on host `vnevado-win10v` under the account `tgs2z`, indicating an intent to dump credentials. Additionally, a process suspiciously stopped services on this host, likely to avoid detection and facilitate data encryption or destruction. This sequence of malicious activities culminated in an attack that involved a replication request sent from VNEVADO-Win10V to VNEVADO-DC.",
