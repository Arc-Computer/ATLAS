  "context": "A 'Kekeo' malware was detected on host `vnevado-win10v` with AadDeviceId `4d8d23e9-a77d-4e33-9435-b8c457e57ca1`, and file `rubeus.exe` is associated with this alert. Since the detection might indicate that the malware was stopped from delivering its payload, it is prudent to check the machine for signs of infection. Further investigation revealed that multiple known public tools, which could also be used for malicious reasons, were dropped on this device to perform various attack stages.",
