  "context": "A security incident was observed starting with a file dropped and launched from a remote location on host `vnevado-win10b`. It involved the execution of the file `psexesvc.exe` by account `fk8mq` with ProcessID `5512`. This could indicate an attacker or malware attempting lateral movement or propagation. Later, an alert was triggered indicating a suspected overpass-the-hash attack (Kerberos) attempted by Emma Clark (Helpdesk Administrator) on VNEVADO-Win10V against VNEVADO-DC.",
  "question": "In the subsequent alert, a user was involved in enumerating SMB sessions on VNEVADO-DC and retrieving recent IP addresses of 2 accounts. Can you identify the name of this user?",
