  "context": "A security incident was reported involving Julian Burke (IT director) who sent a replication request to VNEVADO-DC from the machine VNEVADO-Win10V, which is suspected to be a DCSync attack. During the investigation, it was found that Ethan Brooks (Account Executive) on the same machine enumerated SMB sessions on VNEVADO-DC to retrieve IP addresses of 2 accounts.
