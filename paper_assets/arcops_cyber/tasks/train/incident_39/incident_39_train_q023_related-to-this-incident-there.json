  "context": "A multi-stage security incident involving initial access and possible lateral movement was reported. During the investigation, it was identified that a file `psexesvc.exe` was launched, and commands initiating `rubeus.exe` were executed. This activity is indicative of the Rubeus tool usage to perform Kerberoasting and possibly pass-the-ticket attack techniques.",
  "question": "Related to this incident, there was observed lateral movement to another device following a suspicious network event. Can you identify the IP address associated with the device to which the attacker was moving laterally?",

  "solution_steps": [
    "There is activity indicating the use of the Rubeus tool on host with AadDeviceId `fafdcd65-46c6-45a6-aa85-ec9b77ca0bcb`.",
    "There was a lateral movement observed from IP address `35.202.74.47`."
