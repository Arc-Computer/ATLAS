After this, there was a lateral movement activity detected involving PSExec to the jump server on 2024-07-10 at 11:24:45.260113+00:00. Moreover, a ransomware payload was remotely launched on 2024-07-04 at 22:35:02.812470+00:00, indicating potential encryption of the device's contents. Subsequently, suspicious 'GenRansom' behavior was detected on 2024-07-04 at 22:35:03.581041+00:00, indicating active malware with potential persistence mechanisms in place.",
