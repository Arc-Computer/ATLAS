  "context": "A security incident was reported involving system recovery setting tampering and possible attempts to access Primary Refresh Token (PRT). It was observed that the file `vssblatemp.exe` was executed on host `vnevado-win11t` with commands like `vssblatemp.exe delete shadows /all` and `bcdedit /set recoveryenabled no`. This suggests that adversaries might be trying to delete built-in operating system data and turn off recovery services. Subsequently, there were attempts to access the PRT on the same device.",
  "question": "During the investigation of this security incident, the Mimikatz credential theft tool was detected. Can you provide the file name associated with this detection?",
  "gold_answer": "mimidrv.sys",
  "solution_steps": [
    "System recovery setting tampering was observed on a device by an account with AadUserId `731adb71-b11c-4bbf-850b-57989b350e96`.",
    "There was a possible attempt to access Primary Refresh Token (PRT) by a process with ExtractedFileName `browsercore.exe`.",
    "There was another possible attempt to access Primary Refresh Token (PRT) on a host with AadDeviceId `4d8d23e9-a77d-4e33-9435-b8c457e57ca1`.",
    "The Mimikatz credential theft tool was detected on the device, specifically the file `mimidrv.sys`."
