  "context": "A suspicious WMI process creation incident was observed on a machine on 2024-07-04 at 22:35:03.825729+00:00, which indicates that malware might be using WMI to spawn new processes, breaking process trees and further infecting the machine. As part of this investigation, several processes were noted, including `vssblatemp.exe` and `get-userprttoken.ps1`. These processes might be related to a potential attempt to access Primary Refresh Token (PRT) as observed in the same timeframe.",
