  "context": "On 2024-07-04 at 22:35:02, a security incident involving potentially compromised assets exhibiting ransomware-like behavior was detected. Multiple devices, including host `vnevado-win11t`, appear to be infected by files such as `characterical.zip` and `characterical.zip.lockbit`. An attacker potentially used the specified user account, IP, or device to move laterally across the network and infect other devices with ransomware.",
  "question": "Based on this incident, can you determine the name of another file that is exhibiting ransomware-like behavior, found at the same time as the compromised assets on host `vnevado-win11t`?",
  "gold_answer": "unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit",
  "solution_steps": [
    "The user account with SID `S-0-6-5` is exhibiting ransomware-like behavior.",
    "The file `unstreaming.xlsx.lockbit` suggests ransomware-like activity."
