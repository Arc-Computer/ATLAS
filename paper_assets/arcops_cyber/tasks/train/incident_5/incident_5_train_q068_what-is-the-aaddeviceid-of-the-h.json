  "context": "A ransomware behavior was detected on the host `vnevado-win11t`, which may indicate mass encryption of files by ransomware as part of a larger security incident. The host has the AadDeviceId `e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033`, and further investigation shows that this activity is potentially linked to the Manatee Tempest, a Russia-based cybercriminal group active since June 2014, known for deploying tactics such as drive-by downloads, BLISTER loader, and Cobalt Strike beacons for lateral movement and ransomware deployment. Following these observations, `CommandAndControl` malware was detected, indicating an attempt at lateral movement to another device on the network.",
  "question": "What is the AadDeviceId of the host where 'CommandAndControl' malware was detected during lateral movement?",

    "Suspicious file system changes suggesting ransomware behavior were detected on the host with AadDeviceId `e5799261-6720-4297-961e-bd9ca4275033`.",
    "The actor tracked as Manatee Tempest, known for its diverse cybercriminal activities, targeted an account with the name `dp5hn`.",
