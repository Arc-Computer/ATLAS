  "context": "A security incident involving suspicious access to the LSASS service was recorded, where multiple public tools or custom ones could be used by attackers to obtain clear-text passwords from LSASS service's memory. This was followed by lateral movement activities involving PSExec to jump server and ransomware payload remotely launched on a device. The attackers might be attempting to encrypt content on the device, making it unusable to users. The next alert triggered was due to a suspicious WMI process creation, potentially used by malware to spawn new processes and further infect the machine.",
