  "context": "A security incident involving potentially compromised assets exhibiting ransomware-like behavior was detected, impacting several devices. The incident involved various files such as `get-userprttoken.ps1`, `characterical.zip`, and `characterical.zip.lockbit`, and utilized an IP address `99.83.111.100`. An attacker may be using the user account `dp5hn` with SID `S-1-5-21-1840191660-8534830288-125585561-1522` and might attempt lateral movements across the network to infect more devices with ransomware.",
  "question": "Can you provide the IP address observed in relation to the possible lateral movement that followed this suspicious network event?",
  "gold_answer": "83.162.58.168",
  "solution_steps": [
    "There is ransomware-like behavior detected on the host `vnevado-win11t`.",
    "There is potential lateral movement from an attacker using IP address `83.162.58.168` to exhibit ransomware-like behavior."
