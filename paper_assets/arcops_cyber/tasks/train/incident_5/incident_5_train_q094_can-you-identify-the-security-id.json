  "context": "In a recent security incident, the LSASS process memory was modified on different occasions. It appears attackers might be modifying LSASS memory to bypass security mechanisms or circumvent legitimate checks. Additionally, lateral movement to the jump server `Vnevado-jump` was observed via PSExec. One of the potentially compromised assets has exhibited ransomware-like behavior, impacting multiple devices during the occurrence.",
