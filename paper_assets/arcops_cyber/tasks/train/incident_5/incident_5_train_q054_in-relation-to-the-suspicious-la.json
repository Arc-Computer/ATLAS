  "context": "A security incident was detected involving Command and Control behavior blocked, as malware was found running on the machine `vnevado-win11t` and it already has persistence mechanisms in place. During the investigation, it was noted that a suspicious process `curl http://vectorsandarrows.com` was initiated on the same machine. It was also observed that there was a suspicious WMI process creation on the same machine, which typically suggests malware use of WMI to spawn new processes, breaking process trees and further infecting the machine.",
  "question": "In relation to the suspicious lateral movement observed, can you identify the IP address involved in this possible lateral movement?",
  "gold_answer": "38.142.109.10",
  "solution_steps": [
    "Malware with command and control behavior was blocked on the account `dp5hn`.",
    "Suspicious WMI process creation was observed on the host `vnevado-win11u`.",
    "Possible lateral movement was detected from IP address `38.142.109.10`."
