  "context": "A security incident involving a possible compromised user account was reported, where the account was observed dropping ransomware-related files (`get-userprttoken.ps1`, `characterical.zip`, and `characterical.zip.lockbit`) on several devices. This suggests that an attacker may have compromised the user account to infect many devices with ransomware. The compromised account has the following details: Name: `dp5hn`, AadUserId: `731adb71-b11c-4bbf-850b-57989b350e96`, Sid: `S-1-5-21-1840191660-8534830288-125585561-1522`, IP Address: `99.83.111.100`. Automated remediation actions may have been taken to disable the account.",
  "question": "Following the compromise, there was a possible lateral movement observed. Can you identify the IP address involved in the lateral movement attempt?",

    "A user account was observed dropping a ransomware-related file on the host `vnevado-win11t`.",
    "Lateral movement was observed from the IP address `83.162.58.168` in close time proximity to a suspicious network event."
