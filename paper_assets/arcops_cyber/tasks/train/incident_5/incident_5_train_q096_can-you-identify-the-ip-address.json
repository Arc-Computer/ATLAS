  "context": "A potential attempt to access a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) through the process `browsercore.exe` was detected on 2024-07-04. PRT is crucial for Azure AD authentication across various devices, and attackers might try to exploit it to move laterally or steal credentials. Subsequently, it was identified that a compromised user account was involved in delivering ransomware-related files across multiple devices. This indicates potential lateral movement and broader infection attempts within the network.",
  "question": "Can you identify the IP address associated with the lateral movement to the jump server Vnevado-jump?",
