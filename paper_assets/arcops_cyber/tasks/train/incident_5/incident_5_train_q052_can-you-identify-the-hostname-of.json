  "context": "A suspicious ransomware behavior was detected on the file system of the host `vnevado-win11u`, which might indicate mass encryption of files by ransomware. This potential ransomware activity could be indicative of ransomware activity. Following this, a suspicious WMI process creation was observed on the same machine at around the same time. Malware frequently uses WMI to spawn new processes, breaking process trees and further infecting a machine.",
  "question": "Can you identify the hostname of the machine where the suspicious WMI process creation was last observed?",
