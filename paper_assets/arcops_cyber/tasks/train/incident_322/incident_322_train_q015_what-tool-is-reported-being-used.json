The process identifier was associated with the file `powershell.exe`. Attackers often use this in conjunction with other tools to gather information or persist in their access.",

    "An attacker used `ntdsutil.exe` to dump NTDS.dit, which could be used to obtain user credentials from the domain controller.",
    "The same `ntdsutil.exe` process was used to collect Active Directory information, which may help attackers in persistence or lateral movement within the network."
