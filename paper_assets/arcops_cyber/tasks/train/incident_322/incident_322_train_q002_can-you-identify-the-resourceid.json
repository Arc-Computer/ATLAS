  "context": "A security incident involved suspicious Azure Resource Management (ARM) activities by a user `Hailey Johnson`, who signed in to a risky session. This activity was flagged by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. One part of this incident indicates that the proxy IP address `???` was involved in the suspicious ARM operations. However, it is often seen in malicious activities when threat actors try to hide their source IP. Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager detected a resource management operation from an IP address that is associated with proxy services, such as TOR.",
  "question": "Can you identify the ResourceId related to the ARM operation from the suspicious proxy IP address?",
