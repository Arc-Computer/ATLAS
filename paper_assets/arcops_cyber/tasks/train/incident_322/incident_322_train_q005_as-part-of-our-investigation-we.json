  "context": "During a recent security investigation, we identified multiple suspicious activities involving various endpoints and alerts. Initially, a connection from IP `231.60.52.209` - `vnevado-win11h.vnevado.alpineskihouse.co` to a malicious URL `login.micro.demo.antoinetest.ovh` was detected in proxy logs. This raised concerns about potential unauthorized access or malicious activities on the affected system.",
  "question": "As part of our investigation, we also discovered that attackers might be using a certain process to gather information for persistence or lateral movement in the network. Can you identify the file name of the process that was used in this activity?",
  "gold_answer": "ntdsutil.exe",
  "solution_steps": [
    "A malicious URL was detected in proxy logs from the host `vnevado-win11h` with the IP address `231.60.52.209` connecting to `login.micro.demo.antoinetest.ovh`.",
    "A malicious URL was clicked by the user account `Hailey Johnson`.",
    "There was an Azure Resource Manager operation from a suspicious proxy IP address linked to the host `vnevado-dc`.",
    "The attacker used `ntdsutil.exe` to gather Active Directory information."
