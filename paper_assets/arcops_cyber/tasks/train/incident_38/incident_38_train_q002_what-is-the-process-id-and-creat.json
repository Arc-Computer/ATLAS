This process ran with no command line arguments on the 4th of July, 2024. The legitimate process by this name does not normally exhibit this behavior when ran with no command line arguments and may contain injected extraneous code or be a malicious executable masquerading as legitimate. It is part of a broader security incident which also includes suspicious application window discovery where attackers might be gathering information about a target device or network.",
