  Question: {question}

  Before solving, briefly describe:
  1. What type of problem this is
  2. The key concepts or steps needed
  3. Any potential challenges you see

  Your initial approach (be concise):

  Question: {question}

  Student's approach: {approach}

  First, think about the student's approach (use <thinking> tags for your internal analysis).
  Then provide your teaching guidance (use <teaching> tags for what you'll tell the student).

  <thinking>
  [Analyze the student's approach here - is it correct? What misconceptions might they have? What's the next step they need?]
  </thinking>

  <teaching>
  [Only your guidance to the student goes here. Be concise for correct approaches, more detailed for wrong ones.]
  </teaching>

  Rules:
  - Keep <thinking> and <teaching> separate
  - NEVER solve the problem or give the answer in <teaching>
  - <teaching> should only contain guidance, not your thought process
  - Focus on guiding the student to provide correct answers
