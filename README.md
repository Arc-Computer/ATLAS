# What is Atlas?

Atlas is the learning layer for production agents, giving them a way to adapt and learn in real time from every task. The runtime SDK (`atlas-sdk`) wraps any agent in an adaptive dual-agent reasoning loop (student + teacher) guided by reward signals that triages tasks, probes capability, and chooses the right supervision lane while streaming rich telemetry. This repository, **Atlas Core**, turns those adaptive episodes into new teacher checkpoints with offline GRPO training and provides the reward tooling that powers both halves.

| When you need… | Use | Highlights |
|----------------|-----|------------|
| Runtime continual learning: triage → probe → lane routing, telemetry, JSONL export | [`Arc-Computer/atlas-sdk`](https://github.com/Arc-Computer/atlas-sdk) | Drop-in runtime harness with a verifying teacher, storage helpers (`atlas storage up`), exporter (`arc-atlas`), persona telemetry |
| Offline optimization: GRPO training, reward adapters, analysis utilities | `Arc-Computer/ATLAS` (this repo) | GRPO trainer, RIM reward system, data loaders, launch scripts |

## Architecture at a Glance

- **Reasoning Core** – Student and verifying teacher personas live in `atlas-sdk`, wrapping your agent with adaptive supervision in lanes (`auto`, `paired`, `coach`, `escalate`).
- **Reward System (RIM)** – Shared evaluators score every step and session; the same judges label runtime telemetry and training data.
- **Learning Engine** – This repo’s GRPO trainer ingests exported traces (`arc-atlas`) to produce updated teacher checkpoints.
- **Persistent Memory** – Postgres + JSONL exports capture triage dossiers, adaptive summaries, persona updates, and reward payloads so the learning loop compounds over time.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Wrap your agent with the runtime SDK** – Follow the [`SDK Quickstart`](https://docs.arc.computer/sdk/quickstart) to install `arc-atlas`, point the YAML config at your agent, and run `atlas.core.run`. Each task is triaged, probed, and routed into `auto`, `paired`, `coach`, or `escalate`, while adaptive summaries, persona updates, and rewards are recorded.
2. **Persist and export telemetry** – Enable Postgres via `atlas storage up` and export sessions with `arc-atlas --database-url … --output traces.jsonl`. Every record carries the triage dossier, lane decision, probe confidence, guidance, and reward breakdowns.
3. **Train offline with Atlas Core** – Use this repository’s GRPO pipeline (`python scripts/run_offline_pipeline.py --export-path <traces.jsonl>`) to turn runtime traces into a new teacher checkpoint. Redeploy the checkpoint back through the SDK to close the loop.

This hand-off keeps the learning flywheel tight: runtime captures adaptive behaviour, exports become training data, and Atlas Core ships the update back into production.

## What's in this Repository

- `scripts/run_offline_pipeline.py` – One-command launcher that composes Hydra configs, spins up GRPO training, and handles logging/output directories.
- `configs/` – Hydra library for models, datasets (`runtime_traces.yaml`), trainers (`teacher_grpo.yaml`), and ready-to-run recipes (e.g., `configs/run/teacher_sft.yaml`, `configs/run/teacher_grpo.yaml`).
- `RIM/` – Reward adapters and judge definitions shared between runtime evaluation and offline training.
- `train.py` / `trainers/` – Core GRPO loop, data loaders, and evaluation utilities.
- `docs/` – Mintlify docs (synced with [docs.arc.computer](https://docs.arc.computer)) covering runtime orchestration and training deep dives.

## Configuration Overview

Hydra bundles Atlas defaults into composable groups:

- `model@_global_` → `configs/model/`
- `data@_global_` → `configs/data/`
- `trainer@_global_` → `configs/trainer/`

Starter configs ship in:

- `configs/examples/quickstart.yaml` (minimal overrides for the helper script)
- `configs/run/teacher_rcl.yaml` (reward conditioned learning recipe for GRPO training)

Deep dives and override recipes live in the [Training Configuration guide](https://docs.arc.computer/training/configuration).

## Offline Quickstart

1. **Prepare the runtime export**
   ```bash
   # From the atlas-sdk repo after running adaptive episodes
   atlas storage up  # optional helper to launch Postgres
   arc-atlas --database-url postgresql://atlas:atlas@localhost:5432/atlas \
     --output traces/runtime.jsonl
   ```
   Each record carries `triage_dossier`, `adaptive_summary`, persona usage/updates, plan/step traces, and reward payloads—the exact inputs Atlas Core expects.

2. **Launch GRPO training**
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_offline_pipeline.py \
     --export-path traces/runtime.jsonl \
     output_dir=results/teacher-grpo
   ```
   Override Hydra arguments (model, batch size, GPUs) as needed; the helper wires up `configs/run/teacher_rcl.yaml` by default.

3. **Redeploy the checkpoint**
   Point the runtime SDK at `results/teacher-grpo/rl_checkpoint/` (or your chosen output dir) to load the new teacher, then rerun `atlas.core.run` to close the loop.

## Rewards Only?

Need scoring without training? Import `RIMReward` directly:

```python
from RIM.reward_adapter import RIMReward

reward_system = RIMReward(config_path="configs/rim_config.yaml")
score = reward_system.evaluate(prompt="...", response="...")
print(score.score, score.rationale)
```

## Documentation & Resources

- [Atlas Core Docs](https://docs.arc.computer) – Offline training guides, reward system reference, architecture deep dives
- [SDK Docs](https://docs.arc.computer/sdk/quickstart) – Runtime orchestration, export CLI, online adaptation
- [Technical Report](https://docs.arc.computer/reference/technical-report) – Research, benchmarks, and methodology

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-py312.txt
```

> Need GPU-backed training? Install PyTorch matching your CUDA stack, then run `pip install -r requirements-py312.txt`.
>
> On Linux/CUDA environments the pinned `bitsandbytes` wheel will install automatically; on macOS or Windows it is skipped.

## Development

- Format / lint: `ruff check .`
- Tests: `pytest`
- Docs sanity: `mintlify broken-links` (requires interactive prompt today)
- Type checking: `pyright` (covers `train.py`, offline CLI helpers, and the runtime trace ingest path; see `pyrightconfig.json`)

We track major changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
