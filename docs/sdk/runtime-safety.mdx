Runtime learning is only valuable when it is trustworthy. Atlas combines automated drift detection with a manual review
queue so you can halt regressions before they reach training pipelines. This page explains how to configure those
guardrails and operate the review workflow.

## Safety Controls in the Runtime Config

Add or refine the `runtime_safety` block in your SDK YAML:

```yaml
runtime_safety:
  drift:
    enabled: true
    window: 50
    z_threshold: 3.0
    min_baseline: 5
  review:
    require_approval: true
    default_export_statuses:
      - approved
```

| Parameter | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `drift.enabled` | `true` | Toggle statistical drift detection based on reward deltas. |
| `drift.window` | `50` | Samples used for baseline statistics (increase for noisy domains). |
| `drift.z_threshold` | `3.0` | Standard deviations required to raise a drift alert. |
| `drift.min_baseline` | `5` | Minimum samples before alerts trigger. |
| `review.require_approval` | `true` | Gate exports and learning updates on reviewer approval. |
| `review.default_export_statuses` | `["approved"]` | Review states included when tooling omits explicit filters. |

Drift alerts surface in `sessions.metadata["drift"]` and trigger flags in the review CLI. Review settings feed directly
into `arc-atlas export` / `atlas train`, so production pipelines default to approved sessions only.

## Review Workflow

1. **Approve or quarantine sessions**
   ```bash
   arc-atlas review sessions --database-url postgresql://atlas:atlas@localhost:5433/atlas --status pending
   arc-atlas review approve 123 --database-url postgresql://atlas:atlas@localhost:5433/atlas --note "Clean reward delta"
   arc-atlas review quarantine 456 --database-url postgresql://atlas:atlas@localhost:5433/atlas --note "Investigate drift"
   ```
   The listing groups sessions by review status and highlights drift alerts, reward deltas, and uncertainty changes so
   reviewers can triage quickly.

2. **Export only the data you trust**
   ```bash
   arc-atlas export \
     --database-url postgresql://atlas:atlas@localhost:5433/atlas \
     --output traces/approved.jsonl \
     --include-status approved
   ```
   Omit `--include-status` to inherit `runtime_safety.review.default_export_statuses`. For local testing, set
   `ATLAS_REVIEW_REQUIRE_APPROVAL=0` to bypass the gate—never disable it in production.

3. **Feed the evaluation harnesses**
   The learning evaluation harness counts review statuses in its summaries. Pending sessions are a signal that human
   review is still in progress; include or exclude them deliberately when comparing runs.

## Responding to Drift

- **Alert inspection** – Review the `drift` object in `arc-atlas review sessions` output. It contains z-scores, deltas,
  and reason strings pointing at the underlying metric.
- **Pause updates** – Temporarily disable playbook persistence by setting `learning.update_enabled=false`; this keeps
  existing guidance in place while you investigate.
- **Re-run evaluation** – Use `scripts/eval_learning.py --learning-key <key>` to confirm the issue and gather context for
  root-cause analysis.
- **Rollback** – If a playbook caused the regression, reset it by deleting the entry from `learning_registry` or
  restoring a previously exported playbook, then re-enable updates.

## Database Signals to Monitor

- `sessions.review_status` & `sessions.review_notes` – authoritative state for approval.
- `sessions.metadata.drift` – contains drift z-scores and explanations.
- `learning_registry.updated_at` – spot stale playbooks that may indicate paused updates.
- `trajectory_events.event.event_type` – inspect underlying telemetry (e.g., `reward`, `guidance`, `validation`) when
  diagnosing regressions.

See the [`Database Schema`](/reference/database-schema) reference for column details and index coverage.

## Best Practices

- **Automate reviews** – Alert on pending sessions that exceed a time threshold or have drift alerts; build lightweight
  dashboards from the `sessions` table.
- **Document decisions** – Use `--note` when approving/quarantining so investigators have context later.
- **Audited exports** – Store export manifests alongside training jobs (timestamp, review statuses included, CLI flags).
- **CI safeties** – Keep `review.require_approval=true` in checked-in configs. Only override via env vars inside isolated
  dev environments.

Safeguards are only effective when enforced consistently. Use the runtime safety hooks together—drift detection signals
the problem, review gating ensures only vetted data leaves the system, and evaluation harnesses quantify recovery.
