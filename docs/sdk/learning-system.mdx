Atlas runtime learning exists to make the teacher more effective between offline GRPO cycles. Instead of hard-coding
prompt tweaks or waiting for the next training run, the SDK captures guidance from successful sessions, synthesizes a
“playbook,” and reinjects that context on subsequent requests. This page explains how the learning pipeline works,
how data persists in Postgres, and which configuration levers production teams can use to control it.

## Why Runtime Learning Matters

- **Faster feedback loops** – learning runs on live telemetry, so student/teacher personas improve within hours instead of a full fine-tune.
- **Traceable changes** – every playbook has a hash, metadata, and storage lineage so you can audit who learned what and when.
- **Safe by default** – review gating, drift detection, and update toggles let you pause or roll back learning if behavior regresses.

### Feedback Loop at a Glance

1. **Session executes** – the dual-agent runtime completes a task and logs telemetry into `sessions`, `trajectory_events`, and reward tables.
2. **Reward judges score** – the RIM ensemble produces reward, uncertainty, and escalation data.
3. **Learning synthesizer runs** – after reward evaluation, Atlas calls the `LearningSynthesizer` to summarize salient guidance for student and teacher personas.
4. **Registry update** – `Database.upsert_learning_state` writes the new pamphlet to the `learning_registry` table (keyed by `learning_key`).
5. **Playbook cached** – on the next run for the same key, `resolve_playbook` retrieves and hashes the pamphlet, then injects it into persona prompts.
6. **Evaluation harness audits** – engineering teams run `scripts/eval_learning.py` to track reward deltas, mode shifts, and review status across learning keys.

## Pipeline Components

### Learning Synthesizer (`atlas/learning/synthesizer.py`)

The synthesizer is distinct from reward judges. It:

- runs **after** reward scoring so updates only occur on high-signal sessions,
- consumes trajectory summaries, reward stats, and recent history (bounded by `history_limit`),
- emits structured “student” and “teacher” guidance plus optional session notes,
- uses a dedicated LLM (configurable via `learning.llm`) to transform raw notes into concise playbooks.

When `learning.update_enabled` is `false`, the synthesizer skips persistence but can still write per-session learning
notes for auditing. This is useful for A/B testing new prompts before rolling them out.

### Playbook Resolver (`atlas/learning/playbook.py`)

`resolve_playbook` is invoked during persona construction. It handles:

- fetching the latest registry entry for the `learning_key`,
- trimming long sections to meet token budgets,
- caching the playbook on disk (per role) and computing a SHA256 hash,
- returning both content and metadata so prompts, validation payloads, and cache keys include the hash.

Set `learning.apply_to_prompts=false` to keep generating pamphlets without injecting them into runtime prompts—a common
pattern for staging and smoke tests. The hash still flows through telemetry so you can verify the correct playbook would
have been used.

### Learning Registry (`atlas/runtime/storage/schema.sql`)

`learning_registry` keeps the current pamphlets for each `learning_key`. The table stores a single row per key with:

- `learning_key` – primary identifier (task or project scope).
- `student_learning` / `teacher_learning` – latest pamphlet bodies (text).
- `metadata` – optional JSON payload (e.g., synthesizer audit info, hashes you compute upstream).
- `updated_at` – timestamp of the most recent update.

Because both roles live in the same row, updates atomically replace the student and teacher pamphlets together. Historical
snapshots remain accessible via `sessions.student_learning` and `sessions.teacher_learning`, giving you a time-series view
even as the registry is overwritten with fresher guidance.

### Discovery Telemetry

Autodiscovery (`atlas env init`) persists complementary context in `discovery_runs`. Each record stores module hashes,
autogenerated factory metadata, and preflight results. Learning summaries link back to matching discovery runs so you
can reproduce the environment that produced a given playbook.

## Persistence Topology

```
discovery_runs ─┐
                │
                ▼
          learning_registry ◄── learning synthesizer (updates)
                │
                ▼
            sessions ───► trajectory_events
                │             ▲
                └─ reward_stats│
```

- **`discovery_runs`** captures onboarding metadata and is referenced in learning reports.
- **`sessions`** records adaptive summaries, reward stats, review status, and session-specific learning notes.
- **`trajectory_events`** stores per-step evidence (`event_type`, actor, payload digests).
- **`learning_registry`** contains the most recent playbook per key/role.

Use `learning_key` to join these tables. The learning evaluation harness (below) already performs that join.

## Configuration Reference

Add a `learning` block to your runtime config to control behavior:

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch. Set `false` to run without playbooks or registry updates. |
| `update_enabled` | `true` | Allow the synthesizer to write updated pamphlets. Disable for read-only playbook usage. |
| `llm` | `null` | Override synthesizer model; defaults to the runtime’s standard LLM if omitted. |
| `prompts` | `null` | Custom prompt templates for the synthesizer LLM. |
| `history_limit` | `10` | Max historical sessions considered when generating an update. |
| `session_note_enabled` | `true` | Emit per-session learning notes alongside registry updates. |
| `apply_to_prompts` | `true` | Inject playbooks into persona prompts and validation payloads. |

Example configuration:

```yaml
learning:
  enabled: true
  update_enabled: true
  history_limit: 25
  session_note_enabled: false
  apply_to_prompts: true
  llm:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5-mini
    api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Related Controls

- `orchestration.forced_mode` (see `atlas/config/models.py`) locks the runtime into a specific lane—helpful when you want deterministic evaluation while toggling learning features.
- `runtime_safety.review.require_approval` should remain `true` in production so only reviewed sessions feed the synthesizer. Override via `ATLAS_REVIEW_REQUIRE_APPROVAL=0` for local experiments.
- `runtime_safety.drift` guardrails help spot reward regressions after a playbook change.

## Operating the Learning System

1. **Seed the registry** – run a curated set of tasks with `learning.update_enabled=true` to capture baseline pamphlets. Export these as JSON for code review if needed.
2. **Stage changes** – toggle `apply_to_prompts=false` to generate candidate pamphlets without impacting prompts.
3. **Promote** – flip `apply_to_prompts` back to `true` once the evaluation harness shows improved reward/uncertainty metrics.
4. **Monitor** – use the CLI and dashboards to track `pamphlet_hash` changes, reward drift, and review approvals per learning key.
5. **Rollback** – set `update_enabled=false` (to freeze) or `enabled=false` (to bypass entirely) if drift guardrails or reviewers flag an issue.

Tip: store exported playbooks (from the evaluation harness) alongside release notes so you can diff guidance between deployments.

## Verification & Tooling

Run the learning evaluation harness to audit learning performance without enabling hints:

```bash
python scripts/eval_learning.py \
  --database-url postgresql://atlas:atlas@localhost:5433/atlas \
  --recent-window 10 \
  --baseline-window 50 \
  --summary-only
```

Key options:

- `--filter-project`, `--filter-task`, `--filter-tag` – focus on a specific service or task taxonomy.
- `--learning-key` – target explicit keys.
- `--compare-to results/learning/index.json` – compute deltas against a prior run (manifest generated automatically).
- `--no-markdown` – suppress human-readable reports for CI pipelines.

Outputs land under `results/learning/`:

- `<slug>_summary.json` – structured payload with reward windows, execution-mode histograms, review status counts, and latest pamphlet metadata.
- `<slug>_summary.md` – business-friendly digest ready for incident reviews.
- `index.json` – manifest that drives comparison mode.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Playbook hash does not change after successful runs | `learning.update_enabled` disabled or drift guardrails prevented persistence | Re-enable updates and confirm review approvals; check logs for guardrail warnings. |
| Prompts missing playbook content | `learning.apply_to_prompts=false` or cache invalidation failed | Flip the flag to `true`, clear `.atlas/cache/learning/*`, rerun `atlas run`. |
| Evaluation harness shows empty history | `learning_key` absent in sessions | Ensure `atlas env init` / runtime config tags sessions with consistent metadata. |
| Synthesizer timeouts | LLM provider throttling | Configure `learning.llm` with a provider-specific timeout or reduce `history_limit`. |
