This guide provides the fastest path to running the Atlas SDK. You will clone the repository, set an environment variable, and execute your first task.

<Note>
**Beta notice:** The Atlas SDK runtime is in beta. APIs and configuration keys may evolve—check release notes before upgrading.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

<Note>
Until the Atlas SDK is published on PyPI, install it directly from GitHub. When the package becomes public you can swap the first step for `pip install atlas-sdk`.
</Note>

1. **Clone the SDK repo and install in editable mode**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arc-Computer/atlas-sdk
   cd atlas-sdk
   pip install -e .
   ```
2. **Set your LLM credentials**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
   ```
   <Tip>
   Using Azure OpenAI? Set the usual environment variables (`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`) and update the config’s provider/model entries before running.
   </Tip>
3. **Use a modern version of Python.** The SDK is tested with Python 3.10 and newer.

## Step 1 – Run the Quickstart Task

The `sdk_quickstart.yaml` config is a lightweight configuration that disables storage and prompt rewriting, requiring only an `OPENAI_API_KEY` to get started.

Save the following snippet to a file (e.g., `run_atlas.py`).

```python
from atlas import run

result = run(
    task="Summarize the latest AI news",
    config_path="configs/examples/sdk_quickstart.yaml",
)
print(result.final_answer)
```

<Info>
Alternatively, you can run the snippet directly in your terminal:
```bash
python -c "from atlas import run; result = run(task='Summarize the latest AI news', config_path='configs/examples/sdk_quickstart.yaml'); print(result.final_answer)"
```
</Info>

You should see a short plan-reason-synthesize cycle: the Student drafts a plan, the Teacher verifies it, steps execute, and the final answer prints to your terminal.

## What Just Happened?

Think of `atlas.run` as a project manager who never gets tired:

- **Configure** – the YAML tells the manager which agent to call and how the Student/Teacher/Reward System trio should behave.
- **Plan** – the Student drafts a step-by-step approach for the Teacher to check.
- **Review** – the Teacher approves or tweaks the plan before anything runs.
- **Execute** – each step runs in order, with the Teacher validating outputs.
- **Evaluate** – the Reward System scores the work, deciding whether retries or guidance are needed.

```

## Configuration Breakdown

The `sdk_quickstart.yaml` config defines the runtime behavior. Here’s a high-level look at the key sections:

- **`agent`**: Specifies the agent to run the task. The quickstart uses the OpenAI adapter with `gpt-4o-mini` and no tools, requiring only an `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **`student`**: Configures the planner, executor, and synthesizer roles with their respective prompts and token limits.
- **`teacher`**: Defines the review and guidance agent, which also has its own model and token budget.
- **`orchestration`**: Sets runtime parameters like the number of retries (default: 1) and step timeouts.
- **`rim`** (Reward System): Defines the judges and arbiter that score the final answer for quality and helpfulness. This score determines if a retry is needed.
- **`storage`**: Set to `null` to disable Postgres persistence for a lightweight start.
- **`prompt_rewrite`**: Also `null`. The SDK won't rewrite prompts for persona or style unless you enable this feature.

To add tools, enable persistence, or use a different agent, switch the `config_path` to a more advanced configuration like `configs/examples/openai_agent.yaml` and see the `SDK Configuration` reference for details.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- **Missing API key** – ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or Azure equivalents) are exported in the same shell.
- **Time spent downloading dependencies** – editable installs pull in `litellm`, `httpx`, and friends on the first run; subsequent runs are instant.
- **Model limits** – bump `max_output_tokens` in the config if your summaries get truncated.

## Next Steps

- Dive into [`SDK Configuration`](/sdk/configuration) to customize each YAML block.
- Learn how the planner, reviewer, and evaluator cooperate in [`How Orchestration Works`](/sdk/orchestration).
- Wrap your own agent with the adapters in [`Bring Your Own Agent`](/sdk/adapters).
- Compare runtime vs training expectations in [`Student & Teacher Roles`](/sdk/student-teacher-roles).
