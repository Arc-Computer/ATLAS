## Architectural Overview

ATLAS implements a hybrid learning architecture that separates complex offline training from lightweight online deployment. This approach addresses fundamental limitations in current language model optimization strategies.

## The Two-Phase Paradigm

### Phase 1: Offline Foundation Training

Offline training establishes deep, generalizable skills through reinforcement learning:

```
Offline RL Training (24-48 hours)
├── SFT Warmup: Base reasoning capabilities
├── GRPO Training: Adaptive teaching skills
└── Output: Teacher model with foundational knowledge
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Compute-intensive**: 4-8 H100 GPUs for 2-3 days
- **Data-rich**: Millions of teaching interactions
- **Generalizable**: Skills transfer across domains
- **One-time cost**: Amortized over all deployments

### Phase 2: Online Optimization

Online optimization adapts pre-trained teachers to specific tasks:

```
Online Adaptation (2 hours)
├── Task Analysis: Identify performance gaps
├── Reflective Mutation: Automatic reward engineering
├── Policy Updates: Rapid skill refinement
└── Output: Task-optimized teaching policy
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Lightweight**: ~$10 in API costs
- **Rapid**: 2-hour optimization cycles
- **Safe**: Maintains non-degradation guarantee
- **Continuous**: Improves with deployment

## Technical Implementation

### Offline Training Pipeline

The offline phase uses GRPO (Generalized Reward Policy Optimization) with the following objective:

```python
def grpo_loss(logits, rewards, reference_logits, beta=0.04):
    """
    GRPO loss combining reward maximization with KL constraint

    Args:
        logits: Current policy outputs
        rewards: Performance improvements from teaching
        reference_logits: SFT baseline outputs
        beta: KL divergence coefficient
    """
    policy_logprobs = F.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)
    reference_logprobs = F.log_softmax(reference_logits, dim=-1)

    # Reward-weighted policy gradient
    pg_loss = -(rewards * policy_logprobs).mean()

    # KL divergence constraint
    kl_loss = F.kl_div(policy_logprobs, reference_logprobs, reduction='batchmean')

    return pg_loss + beta * kl_loss
```

### Online Optimization Loop

The online phase implements reflective mutation for continuous improvement:

```python
class OnlineOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, teacher_model, student_model):
        self.teacher = teacher_model
        self.student = student_model
        self.skill_capsules = []

    def optimize(self, task_samples):
        for iteration in range(max_iterations):
            # Phase 1: Evaluate current performance
            baseline_score = self.evaluate(task_samples)

            # Phase 2: Generate teaching variations
            teaching_variants = self.reflective_mutation(
                task_samples,
                current_performance=baseline_score
            )

            # Phase 3: Select best teaching strategy
            best_variant = self.select_optimal(teaching_variants)

            # Phase 4: Create reusable skill capsule
            if best_variant.improvement > threshold:
                self.skill_capsules.append(best_variant)

        return self.skill_capsules
```

## Empirical Validation

### Performance Comparison

| Training Approach | Time to Deploy | Performance Gain | Cost | Generalization |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|------|----------------|
| Fine-tuning | 1-2 weeks | +10-15% | $1000s | Poor |
| Few-shot prompting | Minutes | +3-5% | ~$1 | Limited |
| ATLAS Hybrid | 2 hours* | +15.7% | ~$10 | Excellent |

*With pre-trained teacher models

### Case Study: SRE Task Evolution

The hybrid approach demonstrates its effectiveness in the [SRE root cause analysis task](/examples/sre-root-cause-analysis):

1. **Offline Foundation**: Teacher learns systematic debugging patterns
2. **Online Adaptation**: Specializes for Kubernetes/Istio environments
3. **Result**: Systematic improvement in root cause identification

## Theoretical Foundation

### Why Hybrid Learning Works

The separation of offline and online phases leverages different optimization dynamics:

**Offline Phase Benefits:**
- **Exploration**: Can afford extensive trial-and-error
- **Generalization**: Learns transferable meta-skills
- **Stability**: Controlled environment prevents catastrophic failures

**Online Phase Benefits:**
- **Exploitation**: Focuses on task-specific optimization
- **Efficiency**: Minimal compute requirements
- **Adaptability**: Rapid response to new requirements

### Compounding Intelligence

The hybrid architecture enables "Compounding Intelligence" through:

1. **Skill Accumulation**: Each task creates reusable knowledge
2. **Transfer Learning**: Skills generalize to related problems
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Performance increases with deployment

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Hybrid Training

<Steps>
  <Step title="Offline Foundation">
    Train or download pre-trained teacher models:
    ```bash
    # Option 1: Use pre-trained
    huggingface-cli download Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Thinking

    # Option 2: Train custom
    scripts/launch.sh 8 configs/run/teacher_sft.yaml
    scripts/launch_with_server.sh 4 4 configs/run/teacher_rcl.yaml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Online Optimization">
    Configure task-specific adaptation:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/openai_agent_atlas.sh configs/optimize/default.yaml \
      task_samples=your_task_data.json \
      optimization_steps=100 \
      temperature=0.7
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Enhanced Model">
    Integrate optimized teaching into production:
    ```python
    from atlas_inference import ATLASInference

    atlas = ATLASInference(
        teacher_model=optimized_teacher,
        student_model=your_production_model
    )
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
