This tutorial demonstrates the full power of the ATLAS hybrid architecture by showcasing the online optimization loop (GEPA).

You will walk through:
1.  Using a pre-trained teacher on a challenging task.
2.  Running the GEPA optimization script to evolve a better teaching strategy.
3.  Validating the performance improvement with the new, specialized prompt.

This walkthrough loads the ATLAS-8B-Thinking teacher and Qwen3-4B-Instruct student directly in Colab (choose an A100 runtime) and relies on the reflective mutation loop explained in reference/atlas-sre-diagnosis.md and docs/ATLAS-Technical-Report.pdf.

### Core Workflow

The notebook implements the reflective prompt evolution process described in our research, allowing you to experience how ATLAS learns and adapts in minutes.
