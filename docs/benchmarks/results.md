# Results

Maintain a consistent template when presenting results:

- Hardware: GPUs (e.g., 4Ã—H100), CPU, RAM
- Software: CUDA, driver, PyTorch/vLLM versions
- Data: dataset IDs and splits, sample counts
- Config: key overrides (batch size, num_generations, beta, context lengths)
- Logs: training time, stability notes, and representative qualitative examples

Share links to W&B runs or summary CSVs; avoid committing large logs.
