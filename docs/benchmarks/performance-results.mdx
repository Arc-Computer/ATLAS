|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Average accuracy | 78.0% | 62.3% | **+15.7%**[^1] | p < 0.001 |
| Maximum improvement | 91.9% | 62.3% | **+29.6%** | p < 0.001 |
| Completion rate | ~100% | ~69% | **+31%**[^2] | p < 0.001 |
| Non-degradation rate | 97% | N/A | **97%**[^3] | - |

## Key Findings

### Non-Degradation Analysis

ATLAS achieves a 97% non-degradation rate, meaning only 3% of interactions result in worse performance:

- **Primary cause**: Normalization issues in response parsing (2.1%)
- **Secondary cause**: Over-specification in teaching (0.9%)
- **Target rate**: ≥99% (ongoing optimization)
- **Mitigation**: Improved prompt templates and parsing logic

### Efficiency Gains

The 50% token reduction comes from:

1. **Diagnostic efficiency** (20% reduction): Targeted probing identifies exact capability gaps
2. **Teaching precision** (25% reduction): Focused guidance eliminates unnecessary exploration
3. **Response coherence** (5% reduction): Better-structured outputs require fewer tokens

### Scalability Profile

Performance across different scales:

| Scale | GPUs | Batch Size | Throughput | Latency |
|-------|------|------------|------------|---------|
| Development | 1×T4 | 1 | 2 req/min | 30s |
| Production | 4×A100 | 8 | 16 req/min | 3.75s |
| Enterprise | 8×H100 | 32 | 64 req/min | 0.94s |

## Learning Metrics

### Teaching Effectiveness Score (TES)

```python
TES = (accuracy_gain * completion_rate) / (teaching_tokens / 1000)
```

| Model Pair | TES Score | Interpretation |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| ATLAS-8B + GPT-4 | 0.42 | Excellent |
| ATLAS-8B + Claude-3 | 0.39 | Excellent |
| ATLAS-8B + Llama-70B | 0.36 | Very Good |
| ATLAS-8B + Qwen-4B | 0.31 | Good |

### Learning Rate Analysis

Performance improvement over teaching iterations:

```python
# Measured learning rate per interaction
iteration_1: +8.2%  # Initial diagnostic and teaching
iteration_2: +4.1%  # Refined guidance
iteration_3: +2.3%  # Fine-tuning
iteration_4: +1.1%  # Diminishing returns
```
