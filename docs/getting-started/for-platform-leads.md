# Platform Lead Path: Strategic RCL Implementation

Understand the resource requirements, ROI potential, and rollout strategy for RCL's adaptive teaching framework.

## What RCL Actually Is Today

RCL is a **training framework** for creating adaptive teacher models. It's not yet an SDK or integration layer—it's a research-grade system for training models that learn to teach.

### Current Capabilities
- Two-phase training pipeline (SFT warmup + RL)
- Adaptive teaching with diagnostic probing
- GRPO-based reinforcement learning
- vLLM integration for generation
- DeepSpeed distributed training

### What It's NOT (Yet)
- Not a drop-in SDK
- Not a production inference service
- Not a managed platform
- Integration layer is planned but not built

## Resource Requirements

### Minimum Viable Training
```yaml
Hardware:
  GPUs: 4x A100 (40GB)
  Memory: 512GB RAM
  Storage: 1TB NVMe

Time:
  SFT Warmup: 8-12 hours
  RL Training: 2-3 days
  Total: 3-4 days per model

Team:
  ML Engineers: 1-2
  DevOps: 0.5
  Time Investment: 2 weeks initial setup
```

### Production Training
```yaml
Hardware:
  GPUs: 8x H100 (80GB)
  Memory: 1TB RAM
  Storage: 4TB NVMe

Time:
  SFT Warmup: 4-6 hours
  RL Training: 1-2 days
  Iteration Cycle: Weekly

Team:
  ML Engineers: 2-3
  Platform Engineers: 1
  DevOps: 1
  Time Investment: 1 month full deployment
```

## Cost Analysis

### Training Costs (Cloud)

| Provider | Instance Type | GPUs | Cost/Hour | Training Cost (4 days) |
|----------|--------------|------|-----------|------------------------|
| AWS | p4d.24xlarge | 8x A100 | $32.77 | $3,146 |
| GCP | a2-megagpu-16g | 16x A100 | $55.73 | $5,350 |
| Azure | NC96ads_A100_v4 | 4x A100 | $27.20 | $2,611 |

### On-Premise Costs

| Component | Specification | Cost | Amortized (3yr) |
|-----------|--------------|------|-----------------|
| Server | 8x H100 | $320,000 | $8,889/month |
| Cooling | 40kW capacity | $50,000 | $1,389/month |
| Power | 40kW @ $0.10/kWh | - | $2,880/month |
| **Total** | | | **$13,158/month** |

## ROI Calculation

### Metrics to Track

```python
# Key performance indicators
KPIs = {
    "task_success_rate": {
        "baseline": 0.65,
        "with_rcl": 0.82,  # Based on Arc-ATLAS results
        "improvement": 0.17
    },
    "error_repeat_rate": {
        "baseline": 0.35,
        "with_rcl": 0.08,
        "improvement": -0.27
    },
    "time_to_resolution": {
        "baseline": 45,  # minutes
        "with_rcl": 28,
        "improvement": -17
    }
}
```

### Value Calculation

For a team of 50 developers with agents:

| Metric | Current | With RCL | Annual Value |
|--------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Tasks/day | 200 | 246 (+23%) | $2.3M productivity |
| Errors/day | 70 | 16 (-77%) | $840K reduced rework |
| Support tickets | 35/day | 8/day | $486K support savings |
| **Total Annual Value** | | | **$3.6M** |

ROI = (Value - Cost) / Cost = ($3.6M - $158K) / $158K = **2,178%**

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Month 1)

**Goal**: Validate on single use case

```bash
# Technical validation
- Train teacher model on historical data
- Benchmark against current approach
- Measure improvement metrics

# Resource needs
- 4x A100 for 1 week
- 1 ML engineer
- $5,000 compute budget
```

### Phase 2: Pilot Program (Months 2-3)

**Goal**: Limited production deployment

```yaml
Scope:
  Teams: 1-2 pilot teams
  Use Cases: 2-3 high-value tasks
  Scale: 10% of traffic

Success Criteria:
  - 15%+ improvement in success rate
  - No degradation in latency
  - Positive developer feedback
```

### Phase 3: Scaled Rollout (Months 4-6)

**Goal**: Organization-wide deployment

```yaml
Deployment:
  Teams: All product teams
  Use Cases: 10+ validated patterns
  Scale: 100% of eligible traffic

Infrastructure:
  - Dedicated training cluster
  - Continuous learning pipeline
  - Monitoring & governance
```

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Training instability | Medium | High | Use proven configs, gradual rollout |
| Resource constraints | Low | Medium | Cloud burst capability |
| Integration complexity | High | Medium | Start with standalone deployment |
| Model regression | Low | High | Asymmetric rewards, rollback capability |

### Organizational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Adoption resistance | Medium | High | Show clear ROI, provide training |
| Skill gaps | High | Medium | Hire/train ML engineers |
| Governance concerns | Medium | High | Audit trails, clear policies |

## Governance & Compliance

### Data Governance
```yaml
Training Data:
  - Source: Internal task logs only
  - PII: Removed before training
  - Retention: 90 days
  - Access: ML team only

Model Artifacts:
  - Storage: Encrypted at rest
  - Access: Role-based (RBAC)
  - Versioning: Git-tracked
  - Audit: All changes logged
```

### Model Governance
```yaml
Updates:
  - Frequency: Weekly maximum
  - Testing: Shadow mode required
  - Rollback: < 5 minute RTO
  - Approval: ML lead sign-off

Monitoring:
  - Performance: Real-time dashboards
  - Drift: Daily detection
  - Fairness: Bias testing
  - Explainability: Decision logs
```

- [x] $150K+ annual budget approved
- [x] Executive sponsorship secured

### Red Flags
- [ ] No clear success metrics
