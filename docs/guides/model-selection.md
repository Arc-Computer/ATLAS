# Model Selection

Recommended example teacher: `Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Instruct` (see README). You can configure other models under `configs/model/*` or override via CLI.

## Configure Model

- Select via `- override /model@_global_:` in run YAMLs or with CLI overrides (e.g., `model_name_or_path=...`).
- `hydra_utils.fix_pad_token` ensures pad token safety for Llama/Qwen/Bespoke variants.

## Practical Guidance

- Prefer 7Bâ€“8B for initial experiments; larger models may require stronger offloading and longer training.
- Ensure tokenizer and model are compatible; save tokenizer with final model when exporting.
