The Atlas SDK orchestrator wraps every request in an adaptive dual-agent loop. The runtime triages the task, probes capability, and then pairs your agent (the student) with a verifying teacher that applies the right level of oversight before results ship.

Looking for the personas behind each role? Read the [`Student & Verifying Teacher Roles`](/sdk/student-verifying-teacher-roles) guide after you understand the controller shown here.

## Flow Breakdown

<Steps>
  <Step title="Triage the request">
    A triage adapter builds a dossier from the incoming task, prior personas, and recent telemetry. Custom adapters can enrich the dossier with business-specific metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Probe capability">
    A lightweight probe model scores confidence and surfaces evidence. The orchestrator stores the score, evidence, and lane suggestion in `adaptive_summary`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select supervision lane">
    Based on probe confidence and certification requirements, the orchestrator picks `auto`, `paired`, `coach`, or `escalate`. Manual overrides and mode pins come from `adaptive_teaching`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the dual-agent loop">
    The student plans and executes, while the verifying teacher reviews, validates, and issues guidance according to the active lane. Retries only fire in lanes that permit them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Score and persist">
    RIM judges score the outcome, certification verdicts are recorded, and telemetry flows to the console or storage backends. Export these traces with `arc-atlas` for offline training.
  </Step>
