## Available Models

ATLAS provides pre-trained teacher models optimized for different tasks. All models are 8B parameters and trained using the GRPO algorithm with adaptive dual-agent objectives.

## Teacher Models

### ATLAS-8B-Thinking

<Card title="View on Hugging Face" icon="hugging-face" href="https://huggingface.co/Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Thinking">
  Optimized for mathematical and logical reasoning tasks
</Card>

**Best for:**
- Mathematical problem solving
- Logical reasoning
- Abstract thinking tasks
- Scientific analysis

**Usage:**
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Thinking",
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Thinking"
)
```

**Training:**
- Base model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
- Training method: SFT → GRPO
- Specialization: Reasoning-heavy tasks

### ATLAS-8B-Instruct

<Card title="View on Hugging Face" icon="hugging-face" href="https://huggingface.co/Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Instruct">
  Optimized for code generation and technical instruction
</Card>

**Best for:**
- Code generation
- Technical documentation
- System administration
- API integration

**Usage:**
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Instruct",
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Instruct"
)
```

**Training:**

## Custom Model Training

Train your own teacher models:

```bash
# Using pre-trained as base
scripts/launch.sh 8 configs/run/teacher_sft.yaml \
  model_name_or_path=Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Thinking \
  output_dir=my_custom_teacher

# From scratch with your data
scripts/launch.sh 8 configs/run/teacher_sft.yaml \
  model_name_or_path=Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
  dataset_name=your_dataset
```
