## Abstract

ATLAS (Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System) is a hybrid reinforcement learning architecture that enhances language model performance through adaptive teaching protocols. The system implements a two-phase approach: diagnostic probing to assess student capability, followed by conditional teaching that provides targeted guidance.

Through extensive evaluation on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and system reliability engineering tasks, ATLAS demonstrates:
- **Closed-loop runtime gains**: +15.7% average accuracy, +31% completion, 97% non-degradation, ~50% token savings
- **Offline GRPO gains**: sustained quality improvements when fine-tuning custom teacher checkpoints from production traces

The framework combines offline reinforcement learning for foundational skills with runtime orchestration that keeps quality high in production. Task-specific continual learning is now delivered through the [`atlas-sdk`](https://github.com/Arc-Computer/atlas-sdk) runtime.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Adaptive Teaching Protocol
A two-pass inference mechanism that first diagnoses student capability (≤50 tokens) then provides calibrated guidance (≤200 tokens) based on the assessment.

### 2. Hybrid Learning Architecture
Separation of expensive offline RL training from the managed runtime that captures production traces, enabling rapid adaptation without retraining base student models.

### 3. Compounding Intelligence
Demonstrated skill transfer across domains with up to 83% transfer efficiency, creating accumulating knowledge over time.

### 4. Safety Guarantees
Zero-reward for performance degradation ensures 97% non-degradation rate in production deployments.

## Experimental Results

### Performance Across Model Sizes

| Student Model | Size | Baseline | w/ ATLAS | Improvement |
|--------------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Qwen3-4B | 4B | 62.3% | 78.0% | +15.7% |
| Llama-3.1-8B | 8B | 71.2% | 85.4% | +14.2% |
| Mixtral-8x7B | 47B | 78.5% | 89.1% | +10.6% |
| GPT-4 | ~1.7T | 84.3% | 92.8% | +8.5% |

### Domain-Specific Gains

- **SRE Debugging**: Systematic improvement in root cause analysis and reduced investigation time
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: 15.7% average gain (closed-loop baseline)
- **Code Generation**: 31% completion rate improvement
- **Continual Learning (SDK)**: Use the atlas-sdk runtime for rapid, task-specific adaptation between offline training runs
