## Abstract

ATLAS (Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System) is a hybrid reinforcement learning architecture that enhances language model performance through adaptive teaching protocols. The system implements a two-phase approach: diagnostic probing to assess student capability, followed by conditional teaching that provides targeted guidance.

Through extensive evaluation on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and system reliability engineering tasks, ATLAS demonstrates:
- **15.7% average accuracy improvement** across diverse benchmarks
- **31% increase in task completion rates**
- **97% non-degradation guarantee** ensuring safe deployment
- **50% reduction in token usage** through efficient teaching strategies

The framework combines offline reinforcement learning for foundational skills with online optimization for task-specific adaptation, creating a practical path to continuously improving AI systems.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Adaptive Teaching Protocol
A two-pass inference mechanism that first diagnoses student capability (≤50 tokens) then provides calibrated guidance (≤200 tokens) based on the assessment.

### 2. Hybrid Learning Architecture
Separation of expensive offline RL training from lightweight online optimization, enabling rapid adaptation at ~$10 per task domain.

### 3. Compounding Intelligence
Demonstrated skill transfer across domains with up to 83% transfer efficiency, creating accumulating knowledge over time.

### 4. Safety Guarantees
Zero-reward for performance degradation ensures 97% non-degradation rate in production deployments.
