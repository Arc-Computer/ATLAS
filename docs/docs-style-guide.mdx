description: "Writing principles for Atlas engineering documentation"

## Purpose

This guide establishes shared conventions for Atlas documentation. Our audience is staff-level ML engineers who need concise, high-signal references for training, runtime, and deployment workflows. The goals:

- Deliver answers faster than a thoughtful teammate would.
- Keep terminology and narrative consistent across the blog, SDK docs, and Atlas Core guides.
- Apply the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework so every page has a clear job (learn, solve, build, reference).

## Core Principles

1. **Audience first** – assume the reader ships ML systems professionally. They want runnable commands, switch points, constraints, and links to code—not marketing prose.
2. **Information scent** – every section should answer a question the reader would actually type into search (e.g., "How do I export traces?", "When do I pick GKD vs GRPO?").
3. **One job per page** – identify whether the content is tutorial, how-to, explanation, or reference (Diátaxis). Do not mix more than two modes on a single page.
4. **Narrative parity** – the blog, quickstarts, and detailed guides must tell the same story. If a blog introduces "two gears" for GKD, the training docs must reuse that language.
5. **Show > tell** – lead with commands, YAML snippets, or tables; follow with short explanations. Use callouts for heuristics instead of embedding them in dense paragraphs.

## Diátaxis Mapping for Atlas

| Content Type | Atlas Example | Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tutorial (learning-oriented) | `docs/examples/gkd-dev-example.mdx` | Step-by-step narrative with checkpoints and expected outputs. Avoid branching paths. |
| How-to (task-oriented) | `docs/training/offline/gkd-training.mdx` | Checklist of prerequisites → command → verification. Assume prior knowledge. |
| Explanation (conceptual) | `docs/concepts/reward-design.mdx` | Provide background, diagrams, and trade-offs. No commands. |
| Reference (lookup) | `docs/reference/datasets.mdx` | Tables, field definitions, API signatures. Zero narrative. |

When drafting or editing, state the intended type at the top of the MR/PR to make review easier.

## Structural Guidelines

### Page Headers
- Start with a 2–3 sentence summary that answers "Why should I read this?".
- Follow with a bulleted "You will learn" list or prerequisites when relevant.

### Sections
- Use verbs in headings ("Export traces", "Launch GKD", "Monitor metrics") rather than nouns.
- Keep paragraphs ≤3 sentences. Break long explanations into definition lists or callouts.
- Prefer tables for comparisons (e.g., GKD vs GRPO, diagnostic vs reliability runs).

### Visual Elements
- Use shared components (`<Figure>`, `<Callout>`, `<Tabs>`) instead of raw `<div>` tags so spacing stays consistent across themes.
- Captions should explain *what to notice*, not restate the figure title.

### Code & Commands
- Lead with runnable commands. Immediately below, list the important flags and when to tweak them.
- For Hydra overrides, show both CLI and config-file variants using tabs.
- Include sample output or `math_validation_metrics.json` excerpts to validate success.

### Linking & Cross-Referencing
- Link to the canonical concept once; avoid redefining architecture terms on every page.
- When duplicating content across blog/docs, track the source in the PR description and keep terminology synchronized.

## Tone & Voice

- Write like a senior engineer coaching a peer—direct, specific, and assumption-light.
- Eliminate filler adjectives. Prefer "Run the diagnostic gear (500 steps, 12h)" over "We have already queued a follow-up distillation run...".
- Use our own terminology consistently ("gear", "baseline comparison", "reward-weighted") and define it once.

## Review Checklist

Before merging a docs change:

1. Identify the Diátaxis category and verify the structure matches it.
2. Confirm every section answers a concrete question.
3. Ensure commands are current (copy from scripts/ or configs) and include verification steps.
4. Replace long paragraphs with tables, callouts, or bullet lists where possible.
5. Check cross-page consistency (terminology, command syntax, dataset names).

Adhering to this guide will keep Atlas documentation concise, purposeful, and aligned with the expectations of staff ML engineers who rely on it daily.
