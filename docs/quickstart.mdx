Atlas gives you two complementary workflows: the **runtime SDK**, which wraps your agent in an adaptive dual-agent loop (student + verifying teacher), and the **Atlas Core training stack**, which turns exported traces into new teacher checkpoints. Use this page as the router—each link below sends you to the detailed guide.

**Prefer the hands-on instructions?** Head to the [`SDK Quickstart`](/sdk/quickstart) for the runtime walkthrough or the [`Offline Training Guide`](/training/offline/grpo-training) for GRPO. Keep this page bookmarked to remember the order of operations.

## Pick Your Workflow

- **Runtime orchestration only** — Install the SDK, point it at your agent, run tasks with the verifying teacher in the loop, and (optionally) persist traces. Ideal when you just need quality control and telemetry.  
  → Start with [`SDK Quickstart`](/sdk/quickstart) and the [`Configuration Reference`](/sdk/configuration).

- **Runtime + training pipeline** — Do everything above, then feed the exported JSONL traces into Atlas Core to train or evaluate a new teacher checkpoint.  
  → Follow [`Training Configuration`](/training/configuration) and the [`Offline Training Guide`](/training/offline/grpo-training).

## Runtime Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install & set credentials">
    `pip install arc-atlas`, export your API keys, or add them to `.env`. See Step 0 in the [`SDK Quickstart`](/sdk/quickstart#prerequisites).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bring your own agent">
    Copy the closest template in `atlas-sdk/configs/examples/`, update the `agent` block, and review the dual-agent options in [`SDK Configuration`](/sdk/configuration#agent).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your first task">
    Execute `atlas.core.run(...)` exactly as shown in the quickstart. Watch the console streamer to see which lane the verifying teacher selects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Persist & export (optional)">
    Add a `storage:` block and run `arc-atlas --database-url ... --output traces.jsonl` when you want training-ready JSONL. Reference [`Export Runtime Sessions`](/sdk/export-traces).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Offline Training Checklist (Optional)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load runtime traces">
    Point `configs/data/runtime_traces.yaml` at your exported JSONL. The loader is defined in `custom_data.runtime_trace_data`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch GRPO or scoring">
    Use `python scripts/run_offline_pipeline.py --export-path <traces.jsonl>` or compose Hydra overrides manually. See the [`Offline Training Guide`](/training/offline/grpo-training).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redeploy the verifying teacher">
    Once the run finishes, point the SDK runtime at the new checkpoint and repeat the loop.
  </Step>
</Steps>
