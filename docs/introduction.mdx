description: A Continual Learning Framework for Production LLM Agents
sidebarTitle: Introduction
---

ATLAS (Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System) is an architecture for production teams that need AI agents to improve from user interactions and feedback *after* deployment. It wraps any existing agent framework with the components required to create a closed-loop, continual learning system:

1. **Reasoning Core**: A Teacher-Student model pair that enhances agent capabilities
2. **[Reward System (RIM)](/concepts/reward-design)**: Turns implicit and explicit user feedback into a dense reward signal (achieves 93.7% accuracy on RewardBench V2)
3. **Learning Engine**: Uses online methods like GEPA (Genetic-Pareto prompt optimization) and offline methods like GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) to update models based on rewards
4. **Persistent Memory**: Stores all interactions in structured trace files for analysis and retraining

Together, they form a complete learning loop where interaction traces stream into the reward system, the learning engine upgrades the teacher–student core, and the refreshed policy is redeployed so production agents get demonstrably sharper with every episode.

**The core value:** Rather than treating agents as static and stateless, ATLAS provides the framework for systems that **compound knowledge over time**. This enables building a durable library of domain expertise instead of relearning the same fixes repeatedly.

## The Core Concept: Teacher-Student Paradigm

ATLAS works like a skilled tutor helping a student improve. Your existing AI model (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) is the **student**. ATLAS provides a specialized **teacher** model that analyzes the student's work, identifies areas for improvement, and provides targeted guidance—all at inference time, with no retraining required.

**Example:** When your GPT-5 student attempts a complex reasoning task, the ATLAS teacher reviews the attempt, provides focused teaching (like "Your calculation approach is correct, but check the units"), and the student applies this guidance to produce an improved response.

This delivers measurable results: **+15.7% average accuracy improvement**, **97% non-degradation rate**, and **50% token reduction** across benchmarks.

## How ATLAS Compares to Alternatives

| Approach | Limitation | How ATLAS Solves It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fine-Tuning/RLHF** | Compute-intensive, risks catastrophic forgetting, requires constant retraining when the world changes | **Model-Agnostic Teaching:** Enhances any student model without modifying its weights. Adapts in hours, not weeks, while preserving all original capabilities. |
| **Traditional RL** | Requires massive compute; static rewards | **Hybrid Architecture:** Separates heavy offline training from light, adaptive online optimization. |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Inconsistent, brittle, and hard to scale | **Systematic & Reproducible:** Evolves teaching strategies based on performance data, creating a durable knowledge base. |
| **Retrieval/Memory** | Addresses knowledge gaps but not reasoning | **Improves Core Logic:** The teacher-student paradigm directly enhances the student's reasoning process. |

## The Self-Improvement Workflow

ATLAS provides three operational modes that work together in a complete learning cycle:

1. **[Evaluate](/quickstart#quick-evaluation-5-minutes)** – Capture baseline and teacher-guided traces, then use the RIM reward system to quantify the quality improvement. This is your observation step.
2. **[Optimize](/training/online/optimize-with-atlas)** – Use reward deltas as fitness signals so the prompt optimizer evolves better teaching strategies. Teacher prompts improve, student responses get sharper, rewards climb.
3. **[Train](/first-experiment)** – When you need more than prompt tweaks, use the judged data to update the teacher model weights themselves via reinforcement learning.

This **evaluate → optimize → train** arc is the continual learning loop: fresh interactions enter RIM, the reward signal decides what to keep or discard, and ATLAS updates the components that do the teaching so the deployed agent never goes stale.
