ATLAS (Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System) is an open-source continual learning framework that enhances any language model's performance without modifying its weights.

## Pre-trained Models vs Custom Training

  <Card title="Pre-trained ATLAS Models" icon="box">
    **When to use**: 99% of use cases
    - Works across all domains out-of-the-box
    - Adapts to your specific tasks via online optimization
    - No training infrastructure required
    - Available immediately on HuggingFace
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Teacher Training" icon="graduation-cap">
    **When needed**: Specialized domains
    - Proprietary knowledge not in public models
    - Regulatory compliance requirements
    - Extreme performance optimization needs
    - Requires multi-GPU setup for best performance
  </Card>

## How ATLAS Works

ATLAS uses a hybrid architecture that separates complex offline reinforcement learning (to train expert **teacher** models) from hyper-efficient online optimization (to adapt to specific tasks). This enables any **student** model to achieve enhanced performance with guaranteed safety.

Our system provides a production-ready solution for systematically improving model performance through adaptive teaching protocols, delivering measurable gains like **+165%** performance improvement in just 2 hours.

### Key Features & Performance

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hybrid Learning Architecture" icon="brain">
    Separates heavy offline RL from light online optimization, enabling rapid, production-safe adaptation. This delivered a **+165%** performance gain in just 2 hours.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adaptive Teaching Protocol" icon="arrows-rotate">
    A two-pass system that diagnoses student capability, then provides targeted guidance. This results in a **97% non-degradation rate** and a **50% token reduction**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compounding Intelligence" icon="layer-group">
    Systematically learns from experience to create reusable skills that transfer across domains, resulting in **15x faster incident resolution** in our SRE case study.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Universal Compatibility" icon="plug">
    Enhances any student model (GPT-5, Claude-4, etc.) without modifying weights, delivering a **+15.7%** average accuracy improvement across models.

## Why ATLAS?

| Approach | Limitation | How ATLAS Solves It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traditional RL** | Requires massive compute; static rewards | **Hybrid Architecture:** Separates heavy offline training from light, adaptive online optimization. |
| **Fine-Tuning** | Risks catastrophic forgetting; requires constant retraining | **Model-Agnostic Teaching:** Enhances any student model without modifying its weights, preserving all original capabilities. |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Inconsistent, brittle, and hard to scale | **Systematic & Reproducible:** Evolves teaching strategies based on performance data, creating a durable knowledge base. |
| **Retrieval/Memory** | Addresses knowledge gaps but not reasoning | **Improves Core Logic:** The teacher-student paradigm directly enhances the student's reasoning process. |
