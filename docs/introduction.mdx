## ATLAS: Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System

ATLAS is a memory-based continual learning framework that separates complex reinforcement learning into two complementary phases: offline training of specialized teacher models and online optimization for task-specific adaptation. This hybrid approach enables production agents to improve from experience through adaptive teaching while maintaining strict performance guarantees.

### Key Performance Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="165% Performance Gain" icon="chart-line">
    Achieved through 2-hour online optimization using reflective mutation and policy gradient updates. Total compute cost: ~$10 using Gemini Flash 2.5.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficient Teaching" icon="compress">
    Two-pass protocol with diagnostic probe (≤50 tokens) and adaptive guidance (≤200 tokens) minimizes overhead while maximizing impact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="15.7% Average Accuracy" icon="bullseye">
    Consistent improvement across Arc-ATLAS-Teach-v0 benchmark (32 samples per problem, seed=42).
  </Card>
  <Card title="97% Non-Degradation Rate" icon="shield">
    Performance safety guarantee ensures outputs never fall below baseline model capabilities.

## Why ATLAS: The Hybrid Advantage

Current approaches to improving language model performance face fundamental trade-offs:

- **Traditional RL training** requires extensive compute and fixed reward functions that don't adapt to new scenarios
- **Fine-tuning** risks catastrophic forgetting and requires retraining for each new task or domain
- **Prompt engineering** provides inconsistent results and lacks systematic improvement mechanisms
- **Memory/retrieval systems** address knowledge gaps but don't improve reasoning capabilities

ATLAS resolves these trade-offs through a hybrid architecture that separates concerns:

1. **Offline RL training (GRPO)** - Build foundational teaching skills into specialized models that understand how to diagnose and guide other agents
2. **Online optimization (GEPA)** - Rapidly adapt to specific tasks and domains through evolutionary search, accumulating improvements without retraining
3. **Adaptive teaching protocol** - Efficient two-pass system (diagnostic probe + targeted guidance) that transfers learned skills to any student model

This separation enables **continual learning**: your agents improve from experience and transfer those improvements across tasks, while the offline-trained teachers ensure safety and consistency.

## The ATLAS Advantage

### Hybrid Learning Architecture

ATLAS separates complex, data-intensive offline training from lightweight, production-safe online deployment. This unique approach enables:

- **Deep Foundational Skills**: Teacher agents trained with pedagogically-informed offline RL develop robust, transferable capabilities
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Online optimization with reflective mutation adapts to live data safely and efficiently
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any LLM - GPT, Claude, Llama, or custom models

### Proven Results

Our [foundational research on cross-domain transfer](https://github.com/Arc-Computer/ATLAS/blob/main/research/judgment-gap.md#ablation-study) demonstrates that **teacher-guided agents achieve up to 6x performance improvement compared to unguided baselines on complex coordination tasks**.
