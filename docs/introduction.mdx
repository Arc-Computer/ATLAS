ATLAS (Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System) is an open-source continual learning framework that enhances any language model's performance without modifying its weights.

## Key Terminology

### What is a "Student" in ATLAS?

A **student** is any existing language model that you want to enhance with ATLAS. This can be:
- **Your current production model** (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- **Open-source models** (Llama, Qwen, Mistral)  
- **Your fine-tuned models** (custom domain-specific LLMs)
- **Any API-based LLM** that accepts text prompts

The student model remains **completely unchanged** - ATLAS doesn't modify its weights, architecture, or training. Instead, a specialized **teacher** model provides adaptive guidance to help the student perform better on your specific tasks.

### What is a "Teacher" in ATLAS?

A **teacher** is a specialized 8B parameter model trained specifically to enhance other models' performance. Teachers:
- **Diagnose student capabilities** on each task
- **Generate targeted guidance** adapted to the student's skill level
- **Provide strategic hints** without giving away answers
- **Are domain-specific** (reasoning, coding, etc.)

## How ATLAS Works

ATLAS uses a hybrid architecture that separates complex offline reinforcement learning (to train expert **teacher** models) from hyper-efficient online optimization (to adapt to specific tasks). This enables any **student** model to achieve enhanced performance with guaranteed safety.

Our system provides a production-ready solution for systematically improving model performance through adaptive teaching protocols, delivering measurable gains like **+165%** performance improvement in just 2 hours.

## Why ATLAS?

| Approach | Limitation | How ATLAS Solves It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traditional RL** | Requires massive compute; static rewards | **Hybrid Architecture:** Separates heavy offline training from light, adaptive online optimization. |
| **Fine-Tuning** | Risks catastrophic forgetting; requires constant retraining | **Model-Agnostic Teaching:** Enhances any student model without modifying its weights, preserving all original capabilities. |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Inconsistent, brittle, and hard to scale | **Systematic & Reproducible:** Evolves teaching strategies based on performance data, creating a durable knowledge base. |
| **Retrieval/Memory** | Addresses knowledge gaps but not reasoning | **Improves Core Logic:** The teacher-student paradigm directly enhances the student's reasoning process. |
