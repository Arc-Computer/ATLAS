## ATLAS: Adaptive Teaching and Learning Alignment System

ATLAS is a hybrid reinforcement learning architecture that enhances language model performance through adaptive teaching protocols. The system demonstrates significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Key Performance Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="165% Performance Gain" icon="chart-line">
    Achieved through 2-hour online optimization using reflective mutation and policy gradient updates. Total compute cost: ~$10 using Gemini Flash 2.5.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficient Teaching" icon="compress">
    Two-pass protocol with diagnostic probe (≤50 tokens) and adaptive guidance (≤200 tokens) minimizes overhead while maximizing impact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="15.7% Average Accuracy" icon="bullseye">
    Consistent improvement across Arc-ATLAS-Teach-v0 benchmark (32 samples per problem, seed=42).
  </Card>
  <Card title="97% Non-Degradation Rate" icon="shield">
    Performance safety guarantee ensures outputs never fall below baseline model capabilities.
  </Card>

<Note>
  **Empirical validation:** See [SRE Root Cause Analysis case study](/examples/sre-root-cause-analysis) for detailed performance analysis on production debugging tasks, demonstrating systematic improvement through iterative teaching.
</Note>

## Technical Motivation

Current approaches to improving language model performance face fundamental limitations:

- **Fine-tuning requires** extensive domain-specific datasets and risks catastrophic forgetting
- **Prompt engineering** provides inconsistent results and lacks systematic improvement mechanisms
- **Retrieval augmentation** addresses knowledge gaps but not reasoning capabilities
- **Chain-of-thought** improves step-by-step reasoning but increases token usage significantly

ATLAS addresses these limitations through a novel hybrid architecture combining:
1. **Offline RL training** for foundational skill acquisition
2. **Online optimization** for rapid task-specific adaptation
3. **Adaptive teaching protocols** for efficient knowledge transfer

## The ATLAS Advantage

### Hybrid Learning Architecture

ATLAS separates complex, data-intensive offline training from lightweight, production-safe online deployment. This unique approach enables:

- **Deep Foundational Skills**: Teacher agents trained with pedagogically-informed offline RL develop robust, transferable capabilities
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Online optimization with reflective mutation adapts to live data safely and efficiently
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any LLM - GPT, Claude, Llama, or custom models

### Proven Results

Our [foundational research on cross-domain transfer](https://github.com/Arc-Computer/ATLAS/blob/main/research/judgment-gap.md#ablation-study) demonstrates that **teacher-guided agents achieve up to 6x performance improvement compared to unguided baselines on complex coordination tasks**.

## How ATLAS Works

### Two-Pass Inference Protocol

<Steps>
  <Step title="Diagnostic Probing">
    Teacher assesses student capability in ~50 tokens to understand strengths and weaknesses
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adaptive Guidance">
    Teacher provides calibrated guidance (~200 tokens) tailored to the diagnosed capability level
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enhanced Response">
    Student generates improved response using the adaptive guidance
  </Step>

from examples.utils.atlas_inference import ATLASInference

# Load ATLAS teacher
teacher = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Arc-Intelligence/ATLAS-8B-Thinking",
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# Wrap your existing model
atlas = ATLASInference(
    student_model=your_model,
    teacher_model=teacher
)

# Run with ATLAS enhancement
result = atlas.run_full_protocol("Your task here")
enhanced_response = result["guided_response"]
